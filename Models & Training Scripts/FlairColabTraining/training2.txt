I O
've O

back O
in O

I O
live O
in O

northern O

so O
it O
's O
naturally O
pretty O
cold O
here O
this B-DATE
time I-DATE
of I-DATE
year. I-DATE
I O
always O
bring O
my O
laptop O
with O
me O
to O
classes O
, O
and O
my O
backpack O
is O
always O
pretty O
heavy O
because O
I O
pack O
a O
bunch O
of O
stuff O
in O
it O
, O
and O
the O
laptop O
makes O
it O
even O
worse O
since O
it O
's O
a O
pretty O
heavy O
laptop. O
Last B-TIME
night I-TIME
I O
stayed O
at O
the O
college O
library O
to O
do O
some O
homework O
, O
but O
I O
only O
needed O
a O
notebook O
and O
a O
pen O
, O
so O
I O
decided O
to O
grab O
them O
, O
and O
leave O
my O
backpack O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
my O
stuff O
in O
my O
car. O
I O
left O
the O
backpack O
in O
the O
trunk O
of O
my O
car O
, O
because O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
anyone O
breaking O
a O
window O
of O
my O
car O
to O
steal O
my O
backpack. O
That O
was O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
main O
mistakes O
, O
because O
it O
's O
usually O
way O
colder O
in O
the O
trunk O
than O
in O
the O
cabin O
It O
was O
in O
the O
trunk O
for O
a B-TIME
bit I-TIME
over I-TIME
three I-TIME
hours. I-TIME
The O
temperature O
outside O
was O
around O
24 B-QUANTITY
degrees I-QUANTITY
Fahrenheit I-QUANTITY
( O
-4 B-QUANTITY
Celsius I-QUANTITY
) O
that O
night. O
& O
# O
x200B O
; O
Upon O
returning O
home O
I O
noticed O
that O
the O
laptop B-TECH_ISSUE
did I-TECH_ISSUE
n't I-TECH_ISSUE
power I-TECH_ISSUE
on I-TECH_ISSUE
until I-TECH_ISSUE
I I-TECH_ISSUE
plugged I-TECH_ISSUE
it I-TECH_ISSUE
in I-TECH_ISSUE
, O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
think O
too O
much O
of O
it O
, O
since O
I O
often O
leave O
it O
on O
sleeping O
in O
my O
backpack O
with O
a O
bunch O
of O
tabs O
and O
apps O
open O
, O
which O
usually O
tends O
to O
drain O
the O
battery. O
Plus O
I O
knew O
that O
it O
was O
cold O
outside O
, O
so O
I O
thought O
that O
it O
was O
reasonable O
that O
the O
battery O
would O
drain O
faster O
than O
usual. O
& O
# O
x200B O
; O
A O
bit O
after O
powering O
it O
up O
at O
home O
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
, O
I O
noticed O
that O
the O
battery O
was O
at O
0 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
and O
it O
was O
n't O
charging O
, O
and O
that O
's O
when O
I O
realized O
that O
the O
battery O
probably O
froze O
and O
is O
n't O
functioning O
at O
all. O
After O
looking O
this O
issue O
up O
I O
learned O
that O
some O
batteries O
can O
get O
busted O
if O
left O
in O
the O
cold O
for O
too O
long O
, O
which O
I O
did O
n't O
know O
unfortunately. O
One B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
advices O
that O
I O
found O
online O
was O
letting O
the O
laptop O
to O
get O
back O
into O
it O
's O
normal O
temperature O
, O
so O
I O
just O
left O
it O
charging O
over O
night O
, O
hoping O
that O
at O
some O
point O
at O
night O
it O
would O
come O
back O
into O
working O
state O
and O
would O
start O
charging. O
As O
you O
can O
already O
predict O
, O
that O
did O
n't O
happen. O
So O
this B-TIME
morning I-TIME
I O
unplugged O
it O
and O
left O
it O
at O
home O
to O
sit O
while O
I O
'm O
out O
taking O
care O
of O
my B-DATE
day. I-DATE
Unfortunately O
that O
did O
n't O
have O
any O
effect O
( O
wow O
what O
a O
shocker O
I O
know O
right O
) O
. O
& O
# O
x200B O
; O
I O
was O
pretty O
upset O
when O
I O
came O
home O
and O
found O
it O
in O
the O
same O
state O
I O
left O
it O
in O
, O
and O
me O
having O
a B-DATE
pretty I-DATE
bad I-DATE
week I-DATE
did O
n't O
help O
the O
situation. O
So O
I O
started O
the O
Support B-PRODUCT
Assist I-PRODUCT
hardware O
scan O
, O
which O
did O
n't O
see O
any O
issues. O
I O
'm O
assuming O
that O
the O
Support B-PRODUCT
Assist I-PRODUCT
scans O
do O
n't O
look O
into O
battery O
health. O
So O
I O
opened O
Dell B-HARDWARE
Power I-HARDWARE
manager I-HARDWARE
knowing O
that O
it O
shows O
the O
battery O
health O
, O
hoping O
to O
see O
if O
it O
says O
that O
the O
battery O
is O
missing O
or O
something O
like O
that. O
Like O
you O
can O
see O
in O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
screenshot O
, O
in O
the O
top O
right O
corner O
, O
it O
still O
shows O
that O
the O
battery O
has O
2 B-CARDINAL
out O
of O
4 B-CARDINAL
" O
hearts O
" O
, O
which O
was O
the O
case O
before O
the O
incident. O
So O
it O
's O
either O
that O
the O
application O
sees O
the O
battery O
and O
can O
scan O
the O
battery O
health O
, O
but O
for O
some O
reason O
the O
battery O
ca O
n't O
charge O
, O
OR O
the O
battery O
is O
just O
completely O
dead O
, O
and O
the O
Power B-PRODUCT
Manager I-PRODUCT
app O
just O
shows O
the O
latest O
reading O
that O
it O
has O
saved O
on O
the O
battery O
health O
, O
which O
I O
believe O
is O
the O
case. O
& O
# O
x200B O
; O
In O
desperation O
I O
thought O
that O
maybe O
warming O
up O
the O
battery O
by O
a O
heavy O
load O
task O
would O
possibly O
fix O
the O
situation O
, O
so O
I O
put O
the O
laptop O
in O
the O
Ultra B-PRODUCT
Performance I-PRODUCT
thermal O
setting O
so O
it O
works O
extra O
hard O
and O
loaded O
up O
a O
pretty O
big O
Civ B-PRODUCT
6 I-PRODUCT
save O
to O
let O
it O
warm O
up. O
Unfortunately O
to O
me O
, O
that O
's O
where O
I O
had O
to O
experience O
another O
heartbreak. O
I O
noticed O
that O
I O
was O
getting O
like O
5 B-QUANTITY
frames I-QUANTITY
per I-QUANTITY
second I-QUANTITY
, O
so O
I O
instantly O
thought O
that O
the O
Nvidia B-ORG
GPU B-HARDWARE
is O
n't O
working O
, O
which O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
the O
case. O
& O
# O
x200B O
; O
The O
task O
manager O
only O
showed O
the O
Intel B-ORG
UHD B-HARDWARE
Graphics I-HARDWARE
card I-HARDWARE
, O
as O
you O
can O
see O
in O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
screenshot. O
So O
I O
went O
to O
try O
and O
open O
the O
Nvidia B-ORG
Control B-PRODUCT
Panel I-PRODUCT
app O
and O
the O
Nvidia B-SOFTWARE
GeForce I-SOFTWARE
Experience I-SOFTWARE
app O
to O
see O
if O
there O
's O
a O
way O
to O
make O
the O
computer O
see O
the O
GPU B-HARDWARE
through O
either O
of O
those O
apps O
, O
which O
proved O
to O
be O
unsuccessful O
, O
as O
you O
can O
see O
in O
the O
third B-ORDINAL
and O
fourth B-ORDINAL
screenshots. O
& O
# O
x200B O
; O
And O
that O
's O
where O
I O
'm O
at O
right O
now O
, O
no O
battery B-HARDWARE
and O
no O
gpu B-HARDWARE
because O
of O
a O
stupid O
mistake. O
I O
tried O
restarting O
it O
many O
times O
, O
and O
shutting O
it O
off O
and O
letting O
it O
sit O
, O
and O
trying O
to O
use O
the O
charger O
on O
different O
ports O
and O
nothing O
helped O
so O
far. O
The O
funny O
part O
is O
that O
I O
also O
had O
my O
airpods O
in O
the O
backpack O
that B-TIME
night I-TIME
, O
whos O
battery O
also O
drained. O
They O
're O
charging O
and O
are O
fully O
functional O
, O
so O
at O
least O
there O
's O
one B-CARDINAL
" O
good O
" O
thing O
to O
come O
out O
of O
that. O
& O
# O
x200B O
; O
Is O
this O
the O
end O
for O
me O
right O
now O
, O
or O
is O
there O
anything O
else O
I O
could O
do O
on O
the O
software O
side O
of O
things O
that O
might O
fix O
it O
? O
I O
'm O
not O
at O
all O
a O
computer O
expert O
, O
so O
if O
there O
's O
a O
way O
I O
could O
use O
some O
app O
to O
force O
the O
laptop O
to O
see O
the O
battery O
and O
gpu O
that O
you O
guys O
know O
about O
, O
please O
let O
me O
know O
, O
that O
would O
be O
lifesaving. O
& O
# O
x200B O
; O
If O
not O
, O
then O
hopefully O
my O

would O
be O
in O
any O

useful O
to O
you. O

Hey O
guys O
, O
I O
have O
a O
Dell B-ORG
XPS B-PRODUCT
8940 I-PRODUCT
with O
Crucial B-PRODUCT
RAM I-PRODUCT
64GB I-PRODUCT
Kit I-PRODUCT
( I-PRODUCT
2x32GB I-PRODUCT
) I-PRODUCT
DDR4 O
3200MHz B-QUANTITY
Desktop O
Memory O
CT2K324DFD832A B-CARDINAL
and O
ive O
had O
it O
running O
with O
64gb B-QUANTITY
ram O
for O
about B-DATE
a I-DATE
year I-DATE
now. O
I O
wanted O
to O
add O
an O
additional O
64gb B-QUANTITY
ram O
set O
( O
2 B-CARDINAL
x O
32gb B-QUANTITY
ram O
) O
because O
the B-PRODUCT
xps I-PRODUCT
8940 I-PRODUCT
can O
handle O
128gb B-QUANTITY
ram O
so O
i O
bought O
the O
same O
64gb B-QUANTITY
crucial O
ram O
set O
but O
when O
i O
installed O
it O
, O
the O
desktop O
wouldnt O
boot. O
I O
get O
the O
issue O
of O
2 B-CARDINAL
orange O
flashes O
and O
4 B-CARDINAL
white O
flashes O
which O
means O
its O
a O
ram O
issue. O
But O
what O
was O
weird O
is O
that O
after O
I O
installed O
and O
uninstalled O
the O
additional O
64gb B-QUANTITY
ram O
, O
my O
pc O
wouldnt O
boot O
with O
the O
64gb B-QUANTITY
ram O
originally O
installed O
on O
the O
computer O
either O
, O
it O
would O
only O
book O
with O
one B-CARDINAL
32gb B-QUANTITY
ram B-HARDWARE
stick. I-HARDWARE
I O
originally O
had O
one B-HARDWARE
32gb I-HARDWARE
ram I-HARDWARE
stick I-HARDWARE
in O
each O
while O
ram O
slot O
and O
it O
worked O
before O
i O
tried O
all O
this O
but O
it O
didnt O
work O
after. O
I O
could O
get O
the O
pc O
to O
boot O
with O
just O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
ANY O
of O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
32gb B-QUANTITY
ram I-QUANTITY
sticks O
but O
not O
2 B-CARDINAL
or O
4 B-CARDINAL
of O
them. O
So O
it O
wasnt O
like O
the O
ram B-HARDWARE
was O
defective. O
I O
read O
online O
that O
i O
have O
to O
reset O
the O
bios B-SOFTWARE
by O
removing O
the O
motherboard B-HARDWARE
battery O
which O
i O
did O
but O
that O
didnt O
fix O
the O
problem. O
What O
fixed O
the O
problem O
of O
the O
computer O
not O
booting O
with O
64gb B-PRODUCT
ram I-PRODUCT
( O
even O
though O
it O
originally O
did O
) O
and O
only O
with O
32gb B-PRODUCT
ram I-PRODUCT
was O
placing O
1 B-CARDINAL
ram O
stick O
in O
a O
white O
colored O
ram O
slot O
and O
1 B-CARDINAL
ram O
stick O
in O
the O
black O
colored O
ram O
slot O
even O
though O
they O
originally O
were O
into O
white O
colored O
ram O
slots. O
I O
was O
just O
glad O
that O
i O
got O
my O
original O
64gb B-QUANTITY
ram I-QUANTITY
to O
work. O
So O
i O
thought O
maybe O
the O
additional O
64gb B-QUANTITY
ram O
was O
defective O
so O
i O
got O
a O
replacement O
set O
but O
i O
have O
the O
same O
issue O
with O
the O
replacement O
ram O
set O
and O
cant O
get O
128gb B-QUANTITY
to O
work. O
They O
are O
all O
4 B-CARDINAL
the O
same O

The O

got O
an O
older O
laptop O
, O
a B-PRODUCT
Latitude I-PRODUCT
E5440. I-PRODUCT
My O
company O
supplied O
it O
, O
but O
I O
transferred O
locations. O
The O
new O
location O
gave O
everyone O
brand O
new O
sleek O
laptops O
a B-DATE
month I-DATE
or I-DATE
so I-DATE
before O
I O
came. O
The O
issue O
is O
my O
laptop O
uses O
an O
old O
docking O
station O
where O
the O
laptop O
snaps O
in O
, O
but O
everyone O
else O
just O
plugs O
into O
USB B-PRODUCT
C I-PRODUCT
to O
connect. O
My O
new O
location O
does O
n't O
want O
to O
buy O
the O
dock O
and O
they O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
update O
my O
laptop. O
So O
my O
question O
is O
: O
Can O
I O
use O
a O
USB O
A O
to O
USB O
C O
converter O
and O
still O
use O
my O

Odd O
experience O
with O
Dell. B-ORG
Any O
ideas O
on O
what O
happened O
? O
I O
ordered O
a O
computer O
on O
Dell.com O
back O
in O
April. B-DATE
Checked O
out O
using O
PayPal. B-ORG
A B-DATE
few I-DATE
days I-DATE
after O
ordering O
I O
check O
status O
and O
the O
shipping O
date O
changed O
from O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
days I-DATE
to O
MONTHS B-DATE
later O
in O
October. B-DATE
Disappointing. O
So O
I O
call O
in. O
I O
get O
transferred O
about B-CARDINAL
7 I-CARDINAL
times O
and O
finally O
someone O
tells O
me O
the O
device O
is O
back O
ordered O
and O
Iâ€™ll O
have O
to O
wait. O
So O
I O
suck O
it O
up O
and O
wait. O
They O
had O
nothing O
comparable O
available O
now. O
Then O
in O
July B-DATE
they O
tell O
me O
congrats O
your O
computer O
is O
shipping O
early O
! O
Flash O
forward O
to O
today. B-DATE
I O
get O
a O
weird O
email O
that O
my O
dell O
invoice O
is O
outstanding. O
I O
need O
to O
wire O
money O
ACH O
to O
some O
account O
in O
Pennsylvania. B-GPE
Sounds O
really O
fishy O
but O
it O
has O
lots O
of O
my O
personal O
info. O
I O
hop O
on O
customer O
service O
chat O
to O
see O
if O
itâ€™s O
legit O
and O
they O
canâ€™t O
help. O
So O
they O
give O
me O
a O
number O
to O
call. O
Call O
in O
and O
get O
transferred O
7 B-CARDINAL
times O
( O
not O
exaggerating O
) O
. O
Finally O
a O
guy O
basically O
says O
heâ€™s O
got O
ta O
email O
some O
other O
department O
to O
find O
out. O
At O
this O
point O
Iâ€™m O
livid. O
I O
spent O
months B-DATE
waiting O
on O
an O
order O
that O
told O
me O
it O
would O
ship O
in O
a B-DATE
couple I-DATE

days. I-DATE
Spent O
so O
much O
time O
investigating O
that O
and O
trying O
to O
find O
a O
replacement O
solution. O
Then O
now O
this O
weird O
billing O
thing. O
I O
just O
want O
to O
return O
it O
and O
never O
deal O
with O
Dell B-ORG
again. O
Is O
this O
normal O
to O
send O
an O

to O
a O
regular O
consumer O
like O
this O
? O
Why O
didnâ€™t O
they O
just O
charge O
my O

directly O
? O
The O
email O
address O
that O
sent O
it O
is O
some O

but O
ends O

8500T. B-PRODUCT
I O
am O
peaking O
at O
95-100 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
in O
some O
transcodes O
, O
so O
an O
8700 B-PRODUCT
would O
definitely O
buy O
some O
margin O
for O
those O
cases. O
The O
8700T B-PRODUCT
2.4GHz I-PRODUCT
sell I-PRODUCT
for O
a O
small O
fortune O
, O
probably O
because O
they O
were O
mostly O
OEM B-SHORT_FORM
CPUs B-HARDWARE
and O
not O
many O
made. O
The O
8700 B-PRODUCT
65W B-QUANTITY
version O
can O
be O
found O
relatively O
easily. O
The O
CPU O
heatsink O
in O
the O
Micro B-PRODUCT
is O
aluminum O
, O
and O
frankly O
not O
quite O
a O
beast O
, O
but O
the O
8500T B-PRODUCT
never O
gets O
above O
70C B-QUANTITY
under O
big O
loads O
, O
but O
the O
fan O
never O
ramps O
up O
from O
an O
inaudible O
level. O
The O
PSU B-SHORT_FORM
brick O
I O
got O
with O
it O
is O
130W B-QUANTITY
, O
so O
no O
problem O
there. O
My O

so O
i O
'm O
sure O
the O

be O
fine O
in O
the O
rare O

it O
needs O
to O
work O
hard. O
I O
know O
the O
7060 B-PRODUCT
can O
use O
a O
65W B-QUANTITY

so O
I O
feel O
the O
5060 B-PRODUCT
probably O
could O
too O
, O
but O
before O
I O
spend O
the O

I O

1TB B-QUANTITY

an B-PRODUCT

I O
am O
looking O
to O
upgrade O
the O

The O

However O
for O
the O

I O
would O
like O
to O
know O
if O
I O
have O
to O
stick O
to O

Crucial O

I O

all I-TECH_ISSUE

Could O
someone O

I O

the O

as O
the O

is I-TECH_ISSUE
quite I-TECH_ISSUE
substantial. I-TECH_ISSUE

I O
am O
wondering O
if O
a O

cause O

drain. O
I O
am O
contemplating O
replacing O
this O
NVME B-HARDWARE
with O
a O
different O
one O

if O
those O

maybe O
the O

elsewhere. O
PS. B-SHORT_FORM
The O

really O

But O
when O

I O

since O
I O
only O

it O

that O

Hi O
experts O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
know O
if O
anyone O
knows O
how O
to O
solve O
this O
problem O
with O
my O
keyboard. O
I O
have O
a O
Dell B-ORG
9310 B-PRODUCT
2-in-1 I-PRODUCT
laptop I-PRODUCT
, O
and O
have O
had O
it O
for O
about B-DATE
a I-DATE
year I-DATE
and I-DATE
a I-DATE
half. I-DATE
The O
problem O
started O
to O
happen O
about B-DATE
half I-DATE
a I-DATE
year I-DATE
ago I-DATE
and O
I O
can O
not O
find O
a O
permanent O
solution O
to O
fix O
it. O
Basically O
, O
the O
keyboard B-TECH_ISSUE
would I-TECH_ISSUE
randomly I-TECH_ISSUE
stops I-TECH_ISSUE
responding I-TECH_ISSUE
completely I-TECH_ISSUE
, O
sometimes O
you O
can O
have O
no O
problem O
for O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
days I-DATE
straight O
, O
but O
sometimes O
it O
can O
reappear O
as O
soon O
as O
in O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
mins. I-TIME
Because O
my O
laptop O
is O
a O
2-in-1 B-CARDINAL
so O
it O
can O
be O
flipped O
over O
, O
the O
keyboard O
would O
come O
back O
to O
life O
after O
I O
flipped O
my O
screen O
over O
and O
flipped O
back. O
And O
no O
, O
it O
's O
not O
a O
tablet O
mode O
false O
triggering O
issue O
as O
I O
have O
looked O
into O
this O
before O
and O
it O
was O
not O
a O
tablet O
mode O
cause. O
If O
I O
do O
not O
fix O
it O
by O
flipping O
my O
screen O
back O
and O
forth O
, O
another O
way O
to O
temporary O
bring O
it O
back O
to O
life O
is O
to O
simply O
turn O
off O
my O
laptop O
for O
a O
while O
and O
start O
it O
( O
or O
remove O
the O
battery O
would O
definitely O
do O
so O
) O
. O
Simply O
by O
restarting O
the O
laptop O
while O
the O
issue O
is O
appearing O
, O
would O
not O
fix O
it. O
Sometimes O
when O
I O
was O
browsing O
around O
in O
the O
Bios B-SOFTWARE
setup O
page O
entered O
by O
pressing O
F12 O
or O
F2 O
, O
after O
I O
restarted O
it O
from O
those O
pages O
, O
the O
keyboard O
usually O
would O
be O
fixed O
too O
, O
sometimes O
it O
would O
not. O
I O
have O
tried O
nearly O
everything O
on O
my O
side O
trying O
to O
fix O
it. O
That O
being O
said O
, O
I O
have O
tried O
things O
I O
can O
find O
online O
such O
as O
Dell B-ORG
's O
Bios B-SOFTWARE
update O
, O
keyboard O
driver O
reinstallation O
via O
device B-SOFTWARE
manager I-SOFTWARE
, O
sticky O
keys O
/ O
toggle O
keys O
off O
, O
etc. O
, O
and O
I O
have O
tried O
multiple O
clean O
reinstallations O
of O
Windows B-SOFTWARE
10 I-SOFTWARE
and O
11 B-DATE
( O
everything O
gets O
erased O
in O
case O
there O
is O
some O
applications O
or O
corrupted O
files O
that O
are O
causing O
the O
issue O
) O
. O
An O
external O
keyboard O
would O
work O
, O
and O
in O
the O
Bios B-SOFTWARE
setup O
page O
, O
my O
laptop O
's O
keyboard B-HARDWARE
also O
would O
work O
too O
even O
while O
the O
issue O
just O
appeared O
from O
a O
normal O
use. O
After O
a O
lot O
of O
research O
and O
experience O
, O
I O
do O
not O
think O
it O
is O
a O
hardware O
issue O
, O
but O
anyway O
I O
ordered O
and O
replaced O
the O
keyboard O
thinking O
that O
it O
might O
have O
been O
that O
the O
keyboard O
's O
connectors O
or O
something O
were O
broken. O
However O
, O
the O
problem O
persists O
! O
! O
! O
Now O
, O
my O
conclusion O
is O
that O
it O
is O
likely O
either O
gon O
na O
be O
a O
motherboard B-HARDWARE
issue O
, O
or O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
some O
corrupted O
files O
/ O
setups O
in O
the O
Bios B-SOFTWARE
system. O
The O
reason O
I O
suspect O
that O
it O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
the O
Bios B-SOFTWARE
problm O
, O
is O
because O
I O
have O
been O
keeping O
my O
Bios B-SOFTWARE
version O
up O
to O
date O
from O
every O
new O
release O
by O
Dell B-ORG
since O
I O
first O
purchased O
my O
laptop. O
There O
was O
no O
problem O
for O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
7 I-DATE
months I-DATE
, O
until O
one B-DATE
day I-DATE
it O
started O
to O
appear O
frequently. O
During O
that O
peaceful O
7-month B-DATE
period O
, O
I O
had O
probably O
had O
3 B-CARDINAL
updates O
for O
the O
BIOS B-SOFTWARE
from O
each O
release. O
Therefore O
, O
I O
suspect O
that O
maybe O
the O
newer O
Bios B-SOFTWARE
versions O
after O
my O
original O
one O
has O
all O
contained O
some O
bugs O
that O
have O
been O
affecting O
my O
keyboard. O
Dell B-ORG
's O
technicians O
have O
been O
always O
advising O
me O
to O
update O
BIOS B-SOFTWARE
to O
solve O
this O
issue O
, O
but O
mine O
is O
already O
up O
to O
date. O
Since O
an O
update O
would O
fix O
the O
issue O
, O
I O
wanted O
to O
downgrade O
my O
BIOS B-SOFTWARE
to O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
's I-DATE
version O
before O
the O
problem O
started O
to O
appear. O
But O
I O
still O
have O
not O
figured O
out O
a O
way O
to O
downgrade O
it O
as O
the O
normal O
exe O
application O
download O
and O
automatic O
flash O
process O
would O
not O
succeed O
as O
some O
progress O
was O
blocked O
from O
proceeding O
further. O
Any O
method O
to O
downgrade O
it O
? O
I O
have O
heard O
that O
a O
forceful O
downgrade O
would O
be O
risky O
as O
it O
can O
make O
the O
bios B-SOFTWARE
a O
useless O
brick O
though O
, O
which O
is O
concerning. O
So O
my O
questions O
are O
: O
1. B-CARDINAL
Is O
a O
clean O
install O
of O
the O
windows O
system O
completely O
clean O
( O
like O
can O
files O
/ O
bugs O
/ O
apps O
still O
manage O
to O
escape O
from O
the O
reset O
? O
) O
2. B-ORDINAL
Is O
it O
likely O
the O
Bios O
problem O
? O
3. B-CARDINAL
What O
do O
you O
think O
it O
's O
likely O
the O
causes O
of O
it O
? O
4. B-CARDINAL
What O
are O
your O
suggestions O
to O
diagnose O
them O
and O
get O
the O
problem O
resolved O
? O
Thanks O
! O
! O
! O
If O
you O
have O
more O
questions O
about O
some O
details O
of O
the O
issue O
, O
I O
am O
happy O
to O
share O
them O
for O
you O
to O
help O
further O
investigate O
. O

Before O
I O

I O
need O
to O

clean. O
I O
've O
been O
Apple B-ORG

Do O
n't O

, O
I O
was O

mindless O

praising O
Apple B-ORG

I O
used O
Apple B-ORG
devices O
because O
I O
considered O
them O
as O
the O
best O
**for O
my O

However O
in O
past B-DATE
year I-DATE
or I-DATE
two I-DATE
Apple B-ORG
made O
it O
clear O
that O
I O
'm O
not O

But O
this O
is O
the O
completely O
different O

I O

tell O

Let O
's O
focus O
on O
the O
new O

13 I-PRODUCT
laptop. O
When O
I O
was O
escaping O
the B-LOC
Apple I-LOC

, O
I O
've O
tested O
bazillion B-CARDINAL
laptops. O
The O
one O
that O
passed O
the O
most O
of O
my O
tests O
was O
Dell B-ORG
XPS B-PRODUCT
17. I-PRODUCT
Despite O
few O
shortcomings O
I O
still O
think O
it O
was O
the O
best O
choice O
for O
me. O
Once O
I O
've O
replaced O
my O
main O
laptop O
I O
've O
started O
to O
look O
for O
a O
replacement O
for O
my O
iPad B-PRODUCT
Pro I-PRODUCT
( O
M1 B-PRODUCT
version O
) O
. O
Literally O
, O
days B-DATE
after O
I O
've O
decided O
to O
look O
for O
a O
new O
tablet O
, O
new O
Dell B-ORG
2-in-1 B-PRODUCT
laptop O
was O
released. O
The O
price O
was O
similar O
to O
the O
equivalent O
iPad B-PRODUCT
Pro I-PRODUCT
( O
including O
accessories O
- O
keyboard O
and O
stylus O
) O
but O
instead O
of O
a O
glorified O
iPhone B-PRODUCT
I O
would O
be O
using O
a O
real O
laptop O
in O
a O
form O
of O
a O
tablet. O
After O
checking O
multiple O
reviews O
I O
got O
myself O
a O
brand O
new O
shiny O
Dell B-ORG
2-in-1 B-PRODUCT
laptop I-PRODUCT

And O
this O
is O
where O
the O
things O
went O
sideways. O
But O
before O
I O
start O
bashing O
Dell B-ORG
I O
need O
to O
state O
that O
I O
'm O
using O
Fedora B-PRODUCT
Linux. B-SOFTWARE
The O
only O
moment O
I O
lunched O
Windows B-PRODUCT
was O
to O
download O
new O
version O
of O
Fedora B-PRODUCT
and O
to O
save O
it O
on O
a O
good O
old O

While O
theoretically O
latest O
Fedora B-ORG
( O
and O

seems O
to O
be O
ok O
with O

it O
takes O
more O

a O

to O
say O
that O

There O

no O

I O

I O

relating O
to O

service. O
Unfortunately O
I O
do O
not O
know O
where O
I O
could O
share O
this O
incident O
where O
Dell B-ORG
would O
bother. O
Tldr B-SHORT_FORM
; O
Dell B-ORG
exchanges O
monitors B-HARDWARE
with O
issues O
, O
patch O
only O
that O
issue O
, O
and O
continuously O
recycles O
until O
end O
of O
warranty. O
Bought O
a O
new O
S2421H B-PRODUCT
back O
in O
December B-DATE
2021 I-DATE
, O
and O
10 B-DATE
months I-DATE
in O
the O
monitor O
failed O
to O
accept O
any O
signal O
from O
the O
PC. O
Contacted O
Dell B-ORG
support O
and O
they O
said O
would O
do O
a O
1 B-CARDINAL
to O
1 B-CARDINAL
exchange. O
Everything O
was O
smooth O
and O
they O
covered O
delivery. O
I O
was O
impressed O
until O
I O
noticed O
they O
sent O
me O
an O
old O
refurbished O
monitor. O
Staff O
assured O
that O
the O
refurbished O
are O
well O
tested O
with O
no O
issues. O
One B-DATE
month I-DATE
in I-DATE
, O
the O
film O
on O
the O
screen O
started O
peeling O
off O
( O
likely O
due O
to O
poor O
workmanship O
or O
ageing O
of O
the O
monitor O
) O
. O
Keep O
in O
mind O
Iâ€™ve O
only O
done O
this O
purchase O
less B-DATE
than I-DATE
a I-DATE
year I-DATE
in O
, O
the O
exchanged O
monitor O
should O
not O
show O
signs O
of O
ageing. O
Contacted O
support O
who O
promptly O
agreed O
to O
do O
1 B-CARDINAL
to O
1 B-CARDINAL
exchange. O
At O
this O
point O
I O
requested O
for O
a O
new O
piece O
as O
the O
previous O
assurance O
showed O
no O
sign O
of O
assurance. O
Especially O
how O
I O
changed O
a O
relatively O
new O
one O
with O
possibly O
a O
really O
old O
piece. O
I O
even O
offered O
$ O
for O
a O
higher O
end O
model O
as O
I O
thought O
perhaps O
low O
end O
models O
have O
very O
short O
lifespan. O
The O
staff O
100 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
ignored O
my O
question O
and O
proceeded O
with O
the O
exchange O
details. O
I O
have O
spent O
too O
much O
time O
on O
this O
so O
just O
went O
with O
it O
knowing O
never O
to O
purchase O
monitors O
from O
Dell. B-ORG
Monitor O
was O
exchanged O
again O
with O
an O
old O
refurbished O
set. O
One B-TIME
hour I-TIME
in I-TIME
, O
I O
noticed O
the O
newly O
exchanged O
monitor O
exhibited O
screen O
burn. O
It O
was O
so O
bad O
you O
could O
see O
it O
across O
apps O
( O
alt-tab O
) O
. O
Before O
this O
exchange O
I O
was O
once O
again O
â€œassuredâ€ O
that O
the O
monitors O
are O
tested. O
I O
tried O
contacting O
support O
again O
who O
just O
wanted O
to O
do O
the O
exchange O
without O
addressing O
at O
all O
about O
their O
unethical O
practices O
of O
merely O
exchanging O
with O
old O
pieces O
, O
likely O
hoping O
the O
user O
just O
â€œbear O
with O
itâ€ O
until O
warranty O
ends. O
( O
EDIT O
: O
4 B-DATE

Their O

any O

that O

unlucky O
enough O
to O
buy O
a O
faulty O
piece. O
) O
Two B-CARDINAL
things O
can O
be O
learn O
from O
this. O
The O
assurance O
is O
not O
true O
and O
Dell B-ORG
does O
not O
test O
their O
refurbished O

, O
staff O
are O
only O
trained O
to O
process O
the O
exchange O
and O
give O
â€œassuranceâ€ O
to O
facilitate O
the O
matter. O
Dell B-ORG
( O
or O
Dellâ€™s O
staff O
) O
are O
not O
concerned O
of O
the O
practice O
of O
sending O
the O
old O
monitors O
to O
another O
customer O
over O
and O
over O
until O
end O
of O
life O
or O
end O
of O
warranty. O
They O
make O
the O
exchange O
quick O
and O
hassle O
free O
to O
avoid O
customer O
complains O
well. O
Most O
who O
received O
the O
new O
monitor O
will O
not O
bother O
to O
further O
pry O
and O
the O
issue O
is O
swept O
under O
the O
table O
, O
as O
during O
my O
first B-ORDINAL
exchange. O
Final O
edit O
: O
After O
about B-DATE
2 I-DATE

I O
brought O
up O
this O

: O
â€œthanks O

my O

not O

The O

may O
be O
fine O

may O
be O
faulty O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
matter. O
Based O
on O

Dell B-ORG

Hi O
all O
, O
I O
received O
a O
Dell B-ORG
inspiron O
1545 B-PRODUCT
from O
a O
family O
member O
who O
was O
wanting O
me O
to O
fix O
it O
up O
to O
be O
able O
to O
use. O
I O
upgraded O
the O
ram O
to O
8gb B-QUANTITY
, O
installed O
windows B-SOFTWARE
on O
a O
SSD B-HARDWARE
, O
and O
bought O
a O
processor B-HARDWARE
on O
eBay B-ORG
to O
upgrade O
the O
unit. O
Everything O
worked O
fine O
until O
I O
replaced O
the O
processor B-HARDWARE
, O
and O
now O
the O
unit O
acts O
like O
it O
wants O
to O
start O
but O
will O
not O
boot O
to O
bios B-SOFTWARE
or O
anything O
, O
even O
after O
replacing O
the O
original O
processor. B-HARDWARE
I O
thought O
maybe O
I O
killed O
the O
motherboard B-HARDWARE
doing O
this O
, O
the O
original O
1545 B-PRODUCT
was O
a O
single O
core O
so O
I O
thought O
maybe O
going O
from O
single O
to O
dual O
core O
caused O
the O
issue. O
I O
found O
another O
old O
inspiron B-PRODUCT
someone O
was O
selling O
for O
parts O
around B-MONEY
15 I-MONEY
dollars. I-MONEY
I O
thought O
I O
would O
upgrade O
that O
unit O
instead. O
I O
bought O
a O
computer O
with O
a O
dual B-HARDWARE
core I-HARDWARE
processor I-HARDWARE
and O
again O
, O
everything O
worked O
just O
fine O
until O
I O
attempted O
to O
swap O
out O
the O
cpu. B-HARDWARE
Again O
I O
get O
an O
attempt O
to O
boot O
with O
nothing O
going O
anywhere O
on O
a O
second B-ORDINAL
machine. O
I O
made O
sure O
the O
bios B-SOFTWARE
was O
updated O
, O
redid O
the O
thermal O
paste O
, O
etc O
to O
the O
latest O
version O
before O
upgrading O
the O
cpu. B-HARDWARE
What O
am O
I O
doing O
wrong O
? O
This O
is O
the O
2nd B-ORDINAL
machine O
this O
has O
happened O
to O
, O
so O
I O
am O
thinking O
the O
processor B-HARDWARE
i O
originally O
bought O
might O
be O
faulty O
? O
But O
regardless O
if O
I O
out O
the O
original O
processor B-HARDWARE
back O
nothing O
happens O
as O
well. O
I O
am O
happy O
to O
provide O
more O

unrepairable O
( O
for O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
time O
) O

Hi O
all O
, O
I O
first B-ORDINAL
bought O
an B-PRODUCT
XPS I-PRODUCT
9500 I-PRODUCT
in O
Dec B-DATE
2020. I-DATE
That O
one O
malfunctioned O
beyond O
repair O
within O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
despite O
lengthy O
repair O
jobs O
and O
replacement O
parts. O
I O
was O
provided O
a O
replacement O
laptop. O
This O
one O
has O
now O
had O
the O
same O
fate O
- O
constant O
rebooting O
from O
sleep O
and O
faulty O
touch B-HARDWARE
pad I-HARDWARE
being O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
main O
issues O
, O
even O
after O
a O
replacement O
motherboard B-HARDWARE
and O
touchpad. B-HARDWARE
I O
have O
now O
been O
offered O
a O
replacement O
9500 B-PRODUCT
for O
a O
third B-ORDINAL
time. O
But O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
am O
done O
with O
this O
laptop O
; O
for O
the O
$ O
2000+ B-MONEY
price O
tag O
, O
plus O
weeks B-DATE
of O
wasted O
time O
on O
chat O
support O
and O
engineer O
repairs. O
The O
first B-ORDINAL
was O
even O
sent O
away O
for O
inspection O
before O
the O
decision O
was O
made O
that O
it O
was O
beyond O
repair. O
My O
previous O
XPSâ€™ O
in O
2015 B-DATE
and O
2018 B-DATE
were O
also O
plagued O
with O
issues. O
Iâ€™m O
beginning O
to O
wonder O
if O
itâ€™s O
me O
, O
haha. O
What O
is O
Dellâ€™s O
stance O
on O
replacing O
faulty O
laptops O
with O
the O
latest O
model O
, O
does O
anyone O
know O
? O
I O
donâ€™t O
suppose O
they O
are O
manufacturing O
my O
current O
laptop O
anymore O
( O
not O
that O
I O
would O
trust O
a O
brand O
new O
one O
) O
and O
I O
really O
donâ€™t O
want O
to O
be O
saddled O
with O
a O
refurbished O
model O
. O

Is O
it O
stupid O
to O
continue O
to O
use O
an O
old O
Dell B-ORG
computer O
that O
wo O
n't O
update O
past O
windows B-SOFTWARE
8 I-SOFTWARE
? O
Does O
that O
make O
it O
hackable O
? O

I O
have O
a O
Dell B-ORG
WD19TB B-PRODUCT
Docking O
station. O
It O
works O
great. O
However O
, O
when O
I O
wanted O
to O
plug O
in O
my O
wired O
headphones O
I O
fund O
that O
it O
has O
NO O
headphone O
port. O
I O
want O
to O
plug O
in O
my O
high O
quality O
headphones. O
i O
work O
with O
sound O
, O
quality O
of O
audio O
signal O
is O
important O
to O
me. O
What O
do O
I O
do O
now O
? O
Should O
I O
just O
buy O
a O
USB-C O
- O
3,5mm B-QUANTITY
audio O
jack O
adapter O
and O
plug O
it O
in O
to O
docking O
station O
thunderbolt O
port O
? O
If O
so O
? O
What O
adapter O
would O
be O
optimal O
? O
It O
will O
just O
sit O
there O
, O
plugged O
in O
at O
all O
times. O
Would O
a O
cheap O
mobile O
phone O
adapter O
do O
the O
job O
? O
Or O
should O
I O
look O
for O
something O
else O
? O
Thanks O
! O

So O
i O
have O
this O

I O
have O

When O

sleeps O

plugged O

it O
overheats O
to O
an O
almost O
scalding O

Due O
to O
it O
being O
in O
sleep O

the O

do O
n't O
run O

for O
some O
reason O
it O

even O

if O
it O
's O
plugged O

in O

This O
does O
n't O
happen O
when O
it O

... O
anyone O
have O

Hello O
, O
I O
have O
some O
issues O
regarding O
my O
4 B-DATE
year I-DATE
old I-DATE
Dell B-ORG
XPS B-PRODUCT
9570 I-PRODUCT
4k B-QUANTITY
laptop. O
It O
seems O
that O
my O
battery B-TECH_ISSUE
is I-TECH_ISSUE
getting I-TECH_ISSUE
worse I-TECH_ISSUE
and O
worse. O
It O
did O
not O
bother O
me O
that O
much O
as O
I O
always O
had O
it O
on O
DC O
power O
, O
but O
now O
I O
am O
more O
and O
more O
using O
it O
mobile O
where O
I O
need O
the O
battery. O
I O
have O
observed O
that O
the O
battery O
life O
in O
general O
is O
not O
that O
great O
anymore O
( O
compared O
to O
the O
beginning O
) O
and O
it O
jumps O
from O
50 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
power O
to O
4 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
power O
in O
seconds B-TIME
( O
literally O
! O
) O
. O
I O
have O
no O
issues O
replacing O
the O
battery O
, O
but O
the O
battery O
report O
seems O
to O
confuse O
me O
since O
the O
battery O
capacity O
seems O
to O
be O
82,3 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
- O
which O
seems O
, O
to O
me O
at O
least O
, O
not O
that O
bad. O
My O
questions O
are O
: O
1. B-CARDINAL
Is O
82 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
battery O
capacity O
good O
or O
bad O
? O
Does O
it O
justify O
replacing O
the O
old O
battery O
? O
2. B-CARDINAL
Does O
it O
make O
sense O
to O
upgrade O
the O
RAM B-HARDWARE
from O
16 B-QUANTITY
GB I-QUANTITY
to O
32 B-QUANTITY
GB I-QUANTITY
? O
3. B-CARDINAL
When O
I O
bought O
this O
laptop O
people O
recommended O
me O
to O
replace O
the O
Wifi B-HARDWARE
card. I-HARDWARE
I O
still O
have O
the B-PRODUCT
Killer I-PRODUCT
Wireless. I-PRODUCT
Never O
replaced O
it O
, O
never O
had O
issues O
with O
it. O
Since O
I O
have O
my O
laptop O
opened O
, O
I O
am O
thinking O
whether O
it O
makes O
sense O
to O
also O
replace O
it O
( O
assuming O
it O
costs O
less B-MONEY
than I-MONEY
50â‚¬ I-MONEY
) O
. O
Can O
you O
recommend O
any O
particular O
WifiCard B-HARDWARE
? O
I O
am O
planning O
to O
use O
the O
laptop O
for O
at B-DATE
least I-DATE
2 I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
and O
I O
experienced O
that O
Windows B-PRODUCT
11 I-PRODUCT
does O
not O
run O
that O
smooth O
as O
I O
hoped. O
I O
was O
assuming O
that O
a O
RAM B-HARDWARE
upgrade O
could O
help O
a O
bit. O
: O
) O
Otherwise O
this O
Laptop B-PRODUCT
is O
just O
great O
! O
Thank O
you O
so O
much O

Hey O
guys O
, O
So O
I O
was O
speaking O
to O
Dell B-ORG
rep O
earlier O
about O
a O
technical O
issue O
with O
my O
account O
that O
did O
n't O
even O
get O
sorted O
in O
the O
end O
, O
that O
was O
unrelated O
, O
so O
I O
wo O
n't O
bore O
you O
with O
the O
details. O
Just O
after O
the O
chat O
ended O
though O
I O
noticed O
that O
most O
of O
points O
on O
my O
account O
were O
gone O
! O
After O
doing O
a O
bit O
of O
searching O
I O
noticed O
that O
they O
had O
been O
converted O
to O
Dell B-ORG
cash O
bearing O
in O
mind O
I O
did O
n't O
even O
talk O
to O
rep O
about O
points O
I O
'm O
pretty O
perplexed O
by O
this. O
I O
'm O
not O
looking O
want O
to O
buy O
anything O
from O
Dell B-ORG
until O
at B-DATE
least I-DATE
the I-DATE
spring I-DATE
next I-DATE

having O
Dell B-ORG
cash O
that O
expires O
in O
February B-DATE
is O
pretty O
useless O
to O
me. O
Is O
there O
any O
way O
I O
can O
convert O
the O
cash O
back O
to O
points O
or O
should O
I O
just O
talk O
to O
another O
rep O
and O
try O
and O
get O
them O
to O
convert O
the O
cash O
back O
to O
points O
? O
Considering O
I O
did O
n't O
even O
ask O
for O
the O
points O
to O
be O
converted O
it O
seems O
unfair O
that O
I O
'm O
stuck O

this O
cash. O

Hi O

my O

But O
... O

no I-TECH_ISSUE

Went O

Wanted O
32gb B-QUANTITY

so O

as O

as O
I O
could. O
It O
lasted O
two B-DATE

there O
was O
a O

error. I-TECH_ISSUE
I O
had O
paid O
for O
the O
" O
premium O

" O
so O
of O

contacted O
them. O
After O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
hours I-TIME
they O
decided O
the O
best O
thing O
to O
do O
would O
be O
to O
send B-NON_TECH_RESOLUTION
me I-NON_TECH_RESOLUTION
a I-NON_TECH_RESOLUTION

I O
was O
frustrated O
with O
this O

it O
was O
a O

two B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
before O
an O

was O
fairly O
terrible O
to O
start O

what O
can O
you O
do O
? O
Promised O

have O
a O

with O
me O
a B-DATE

Went O
though O
all O
the O

I O

etc. O
Agreed O
the O
replacement. O
Like O
for O
like. O
We O
are O
now O
four B-DATE

later. I-DATE
No O
replacement. O
No O

other O
than O
the O

I O
have O
spent O

we O
still O

Hello O
everyone. O
I O
got O
the O
dock O
today B-DATE
, O
and O
wanted O
to O
connect O
two B-CARDINAL

it O

connect O
the O
dock O
via O
a O

a O

The O
dock O
has O
2xDP B-QUANTITY
ports O
and O
1xHDMI B-QUANTITY
port O
( O
my O
monitors B-HARDWARE
support O
exactly O
those O
two B-CARDINAL
) O
. O
I O
bought O
that O
dock O
specifically O
because O
of O
the O
two B-CARDINAL

, O
with O
the O
idea O
to O
connect O
both O
monitors O
to O
those O
ports O
and O
use O
in O

mode. O
The O
thing O
is O
, O
once O
I O
connect O
both O
monitors O
, O
they O
are O
mirrored. O
There O
's O
no O

and O
it O
always O

Fixing O
Dual-Cable O
Dock O
USB O
Issues O
( O
WD19DC B-PRODUCT
) O

I O
recently O
got O
a O
new O
Precision B-PRODUCT
7560 I-PRODUCT
mobile O
workstation O
and O
tried O
to O
connect O
it O
to O
my O
WD19DC B-PRODUCT
only O
to O
notice O
that O
USB O
devices O
plugged O
into O
the O
dock O
are O
not O
working O
at O
all. O
Plugging O
into O
the O
ports O
of O
the O
notebook O
directly O
worked O
fine O
but O
only O
the O
connection O
via O
the O
dock O
seemed O
to O
fail. O
The O
WD19DC B-PRODUCT
has O
a O
dual O
USB-C O
cable O
and O
is O
the O
recommended O
dock O
for O
the O
7560 B-PRODUCT
according O
to O
the O
official O
compatibility O
guide O
( O
even O
though O
the O
7560 B-PRODUCT
has O
dual O
TB4 O
) O
. O
I O
tried O
reconnecting O
the O
dock O
, O
restarting O
both O
devices O
, O
plugging O
in O
the O
USB O
devices O
multiple O
times O
into O
the O
dock O
but O
nothing O
worked. O
However O
, O
I O
remembered O
from O
previous O
struggle O
with O
other O
Dell B-ORG
notebooks O
, O
that O
for O
some O
reason O
not O
both O
cables O
are O
equally O
used O
for O
the O
USB O
connection. O
So O
I O
tried O
to O
plug O
in O
only B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
of O
the O
cables O
and O
even O
though O
the O
graphics O
seemed O
unable O
to O
handle O
it O
( O
seeing O
only O
black O
bg O
with O
mouse O
pointer O
) O
, O
my O
USB O
keyboard O
instantly O
connected. O
So O
I O
tried O
rearranging O
and O
rotating O
the O
USB-C O
cables O
( O
they O
're O
clipped O
together O
with O
magnets O
) O
and O
finally O
it O
worked O
! O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
, O
but O
I O
think O
it O
has O
something O
to O
do O
with O
the O
order O
in O
which O
the O
dock O
is O
registering O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
USB-C O
connections O
with O
the O
notebook O
's O
controller. O
You O
can O
see O
that O
when O
plugging O
in O
both O
cables O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
LEDs O
of O
the O
plugs O
turn O
on O
one O
after O
another O
with O
a O
delay O
of O
at B-TIME
least I-TIME
half I-TIME
a I-TIME
second. I-TIME
Maybe O
only B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
of O
the O
cables O
is O
able O
to O
carry O
the O
USB O
signal O
and O
if O
not O
plugged O
into O
the O
correct O
port O
in O
the O
right O
order O
both O
notebook O
and O
dock O
disable O
forwarding O
USB O
connections. O
I O
had O
some O
unpleasant O
experience O
with O
Dell B-ORG
Docks B-PRODUCT
in O
the O
past O
( O
e.g. O
knocking O

in O
certain O
situations O
, O
which O
is O
an O

) O
so O
I O
'm O
not O
very O
surprised O

That O

all O

the O

Dell B-ORG

Syncreon B-ORG

It O

Neither O

it O

Moreover O
, O
they O
were O

able O
to O

it O
to O

I O

I O
ask O

I O

If O
they O

they O
would O
stop O

They B-NON_TECH_ISSUE

They B-NON_TECH_ISSUE
never I-NON_TECH_ISSUE
receive I-NON_TECH_ISSUE
my I-NON_TECH_ISSUE

information I-NON_TECH_ISSUE
despite O
updating O
it O
on O
the O
Dell B-ORG
website O
and O
in O
the O
shipping O
information O

Performance O
depends O
on O
RAM B-SHORT_FORM

Mostly O

However O
