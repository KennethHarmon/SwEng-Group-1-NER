What O
do O
you O
think O
about O
it O
? O
I O
would O
like O
to O
buy O
this O

? O
Do O
you O
think O
it O
can O
easily O
be O
folded O
for O
carrying O
in O
a O
backpack O
? O
Or O
it O
would O
be O
better O

have O
a O
lock O
with O
a O
spiral O
wire O
( O

at O

I O
ca O

And O
Dell B-ORG
promises O
to O
send O
a O

help. O
for O
your O
information O
, O
I O
have O
waited O
from O
Thursday B-DATE
3rd I-DATE
Nov I-DATE
until O
8st B-DATE
Nov I-DATE
2021 I-DATE
to O
get O
a O
technician B-PERSON

Dell B-ORG
sends O
the O
motherboard B-HARDWARE
to O
the O
technician B-PERSON
and O
asks O
them O
to O
replace B-TECH_RESOLUTION
it I-TECH_RESOLUTION
, O
however O
, O
workstation B-PRODUCT
5820 I-PRODUCT
is O
not O
the O
regular O
type O
of O
Dell B-ORG
product O
, O
and O
the O
technicians B-PERSON
are O
not O
trained O
to O
disassemble B-TECH_RESOLUTION
the I-TECH_RESOLUTION
machine. I-TECH_RESOLUTION
So O
the O
technician B-PERSON
decided O
to O
help O
me O
test B-TECH_RESOLUTION
data I-TECH_RESOLUTION
rather O
than O
tearing O
the O
machine O
apart O
, O
which O
might O
cause O
extra O
damage. O
The O
reason O
that O
technician B-PERSON
does O
n't O
suggest O
I O
replace O
the O
motherboard B-HARDWARE
was O
due O
to O
two B-CARDINAL
reasons. O
First B-ORDINAL
, O
Dell B-ORG
did O
n't O
send O
the O
motherboard B-HARDWARE
properly O
, O
and O
the O
part O
might O
have O
already O
been O
damaged O
from O
transition O
( O
the O
technician B-PERSON
showed O
me O
the O
part B-TECH_ISSUE
of I-TECH_ISSUE
the I-TECH_ISSUE
motherboard I-TECH_ISSUE
already I-TECH_ISSUE
split I-TECH_ISSUE
) O
, O
Second B-ORDINAL
, O
the O
technician B-PERSON
did O
n't O
train O
to O
replace O
this O
particular O
type O
of O
device B-HARDWARE
and O
he O
told O
me O

Dell B-ORG
) O
. O
Also O
, O
now O
my O
keyboard B-HARDWARE
was O
almost O
completely O
unresponsive. O
I O
thought O
maybe O
I O
fucked O
up O
something O
on O
the O
motherboard O
during O
instillation. O
So O
I O
took O
out O
the O
battery O
and O
ran O
it O
with O
just O
AC O
power. O
It O
worked O
fine O
and O
the O
keyboard O
was O
responsive O
again. O
So O
I O
guess O
its O
just O
the O
battery O
? O
After O
that O
I O
opened O
up O
the O
laptop O
and O
tried O
plugging O
in O
the O
battery O
again O
, O
but O
it O
was O
the O
same O
problem. O
No B-TECH_ISSUE
battery I-TECH_ISSUE
detected I-TECH_ISSUE
, I-TECH_ISSUE
and I-TECH_ISSUE
the I-TECH_ISSUE
keyboard I-TECH_ISSUE
is I-TECH_ISSUE
unresponsive. I-TECH_ISSUE
Am O
I O
that O

The O
problem O
I O

getting O
is O
that O
the O
whole O

suddenly O
freezes O
up O
( O
sometimes O

it O
either O

Powering O

it O

It O

and O
tells O
me O
the O
hardware O
is O
good O
but O
will O
restart O
and O
install O

The O
only O
way O
to O
reset O
the O

is O
to O
power O
off O

unplug O

remove O

The O
problem O
occurs O
randomly. O
There O
is O

pattern O
in O
when O
it O
cuts O

Sometimes O
you O
get O
a O
warning O
when O
it O

the O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
can O
think O
it O
could O
be O
is O
that O
somehow O
the O

out. O
But O
all O

it O

ca O
