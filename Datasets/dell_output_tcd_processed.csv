Lock Kensigton for XPS
"Hello! What do you think about it? I would like to buy this lock for when I use my laptop on the go. Does it have any contraindications? Do you think it can easily be folded for carrying in a backpack?

Or it would be better for transport to have a lock with a spiral wire (but I can't find compatibility with XPS 9720) ...

Dell Latitude 5490 suggestions for LCD upgrade
"So, for those of you enthusiasts who piece things together:

I got a Latitude 5490. Standard i5-8350u model. Someone fried the keyboard and touchpad, but a full palmrest/touchpad/keyboard assembly was $25USD used, so I picked that up.

The screen, like most of this model is merely okay (it is the FHD 1080p).  Does anyone know of a compatible replacement FHD-IPS LCD screen I can get that's brighter than the stock? I don't want to put a ton into it, but I'm considering doing the swap."

Please help me remove/disable/bypass the dell pre-boot system performance check (SupportAssist)?
"I have had an Inspiron 7000 series for a few years now. It's always had a problem with the graphics fan and every restart it will scream obnoxiously loud to notify me that it thinks the fan is broken - I don't care if it is, the thing works fine. This is especially annoying when it decides to reboot in the middle of the night and wake the whole damn house up with ear-piercing screeching

After hours of trawling through bios settings, searching for work arounds online, I am at a loss. It appears there is no way to disable or remove this pre-boot system check? 

I am prepared to do anything to get this thing resolved. Is there a partition on the HDD I can just blow away? Is there a non-dell bios I can flash onto it to remove this crap? Can I just find the on-board speaker causing the noise and rip it off? Open to suggestions. 

Thanks!"

XPS 15 9500 unrepairable (for the second time)
"Hi all,

I first bought an XPS 9500 in Dec 2020.

That one malfunctioned beyond repair within the first year, despite lengthy repair jobs and replacement parts.  I was provided a replacement laptop.

This one has now had the same fate - constant rebooting from sleep and faulty touch pad being the two main issues, even after a replacement motherboard and touchpad. 

I have now been offered a replacement 9500 for a third time. 

But I feel like I am done with this laptop; for the $2000+ price tag, plus weeks of wasted time on chat support and engineer repairs. 

The first was even sent away for inspection before the decision was made that it was beyond repair. 

My previous XPSâ€™ in 2015 and 2018 were also plagued with issues. Iâ€™m beginning to wonder if itâ€™s me, haha. 

What is Dellâ€™s stance on replacing faulty laptops with the latest model, does anyone know? 

I donâ€™t suppose they are manufacturing my current laptop anymore (not that I would trust a brand new one) and I really donâ€™t want to be saddled with a refurbished model."
"Laptop battery won't charge fully, done self troubleshooting without success, looking for more advice"
"So, as the title says, I have a Dell brand laptop, a 'New Inspiron 15', specifically, and I've had problems with it before, including in particular the battery, and at that time, it was under the warranty of the device, and so I was able to get it professionally fixed. However, between then and now, I have noticed that it was not charging fully, only to a max of 60%, which means I have to spend more time anchored to an outlet, and it dies more often. I've looked on the Dell website, I've watched troubleshooting videos, I've adjusted the settings of the battery in the basic 'Systems' tab to balanced, as well as also adjusting the settings in the more advanced 'InsydeH20 Setup Utility' to both 'Custom' and 'Standard', and I've run the Diagnostics program, which said the device was functioning, fine, though it still won't charge beyond 60%. Is there something else I've missed that I can do, or is it a problem with the hardware that the diagnostics missed?"

Hi I have mostly macs. I am awaiting the arrival of new power supply fan for Dell Inspiron, so at the moment the computer is sitting on  my desk dissasembled so I can't turn it on to check to see what OS it goes up to, but I tihnk it only goes up to an old one. I use this computer pretty much only to access the internet.

I am wondering if having such an old OS makes the computer more likely to be hacked? Is there anything i should do to upgrade? Im ok with slowish speed etc, my main concern is security since I have used the computer to pay credit card bills etc.

Thank you!"
Screen issue with Latitude 3420
Dell Laptop Inspiron 15-3567 won't restart when commanded to or upon the completion of a software update
"Hi guys,  


Could I please get some help regarding the issue I mentioned in the subject of the post? So, basically, my laptop can power up completely fine using the power button but whenever I need to restart my laptop, either by using the command or when completing the final steps of a software update, it won't restart. The laptop screen goes to pitch black before dimly lighting up and going to pitch black again, it gets stuck in this loop. Is there a way to resolve this issue, or do I need to consider looking at newer Dell models since I'm a fan?  


(**Side note**: My laptop even showed a **BSOD error** a couple of times with the code being system service exception or something like that, can't really recall but it still boots up fine) 

Thanks for any responses :)"

Dell precision 3560 camera quality
"Hi,

I recently bought a new Dell precision 3560 (MGXH1), now I just tested the camera before a job interview and found the quality was really poor, blurry and grainy vision. I tried looking in the settings, but nothing seems to help. Even the camera on another 7 year old laptop was better than the Dell one. now I paid a lot of money for this laptop, so I would expect this to have a somewhat decent quality camera or at least as good or better than an old laptop. 
Can anyone here help me? Is it just a bad camera or should I take this up with Dell?

This doesn't happen when it's off only in sleep/hibernation... anyone have any suggestions or recommendations on why this is happening and what I should do to ensure I don't accidentally cook my battery."

My Dell Inspiron 14 acted very strange today. Should I be worried? What should I do?
"I bought that laptop almost a year ago
I was and still to this day rarely use it. A couple of times here and there. Almost never daily.
In August, after months without using it, I tried to open it and the computer acted like it was dead. Plugged in or not, computer would not start.
Called Dell, they send a guy to repair it. He changed the whole motherboard,  he said things like that can happen even if you barely use the laptop.
Since August, almost no use (less than 10 times since maybe)
Was using it today for work, worked fine. No problems really. Had to charge it since the battery was almost dead. Got a full battery charge. At the end of my shift, I put the laptop back in my backpack
I wanted to use it 30 minutes ago and it was burning hot. Like burning, burning hot. It hurt my hand when I touched it and the fan was running like crazy, you could hear it. I thought the computer was about to burn really. The smell was weird too. Like a burnt smell.
I turned it off and let it cool down next to a opened window so fresh air could help cooling it down.
I turned it back on after 10-15 minutes, the laptop ain't burning hot like it was, but the battery was almost at 0% while 2 hours ago, it was at 100%
What happened?
Should I be worried
How is it possible that a barely used laptop have so much issues in less than a year?"
Dell OptiPlex 3070 MICRO - 64GB DDR4 2666 Mhz RAM upgrade possible?

Even though Dell (and Crucial website) indicates that the maximum supported is 32 GB ([https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-us/optiplex-3070-desktop/opti3070\_micro\_setiup\_specs/memory?guid=guid-e34c943c-4023-4f5b-a559-d2b5f4cf7604](https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-us/optiplex-3070-desktop/opti3070_micro_setiup_specs/memory?guid=guid-e34c943c-4023-4f5b-a559-d2b5f4cf7604)), apparently unofficially the OptiPlex 3070 Micro may support up to 64GB

&#x200B;

Also, could anyone confirm if it supports only 2666 Mhz or 3200 Mhz is also supported?

XPS 9570 battery issues (and more)
"Hello,

I have some issues regarding my 4 year old Dell XPS 9570 4k laptop. It seems that my battery is getting worse and worse. It did not bother me that much as I always had it on DC power, but now I am more and more using it mobile where I need the battery. 

I have observed that the battery life in general is not that great anymore (compared to the beginning) and it jumps from 50% power to 4% power in seconds (literally!).  I have no issues replacing the battery, but the battery report seems to confuse me since the battery capacity seems to be 82,3% - which seems, to me at least, not that bad.

My questions are:

1. Is 82% battery capacity good or bad? Does it justify replacing the old battery?
2. Does it make sense to upgrade the RAM from 16 GB to 32 GB?
3. When I bought this laptop people recommended me to replace the Wifi card. I still have the Killer Wireless. Never replaced it, never had issues with it. Since I have my laptop opened, I am thinking whether it makes sense to also replace it (assuming it costs less than 50â‚¬). Can you recommend any particular WifiCard?

I am planning to use the laptop for at least 2 years, and I experienced that Windows 11 does not run that smooth as I hoped. I was assuming that a RAM upgrade could help a bit. :) Otherwise this Laptop is just great!

Thank you so much for your help! :)"

Dell XPS 17 9720 - Is this normal?
"&#x200B;

[Red line is where I see the bleed](https://preview.redd.it/p6sdg11v35y91.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dfa3a2829aa5cc7a1bbd9544c6994471e35886d7)

I bought a certified refurbished Dell XPS 17 9720 4K Touch from the outlet store and recieved it yesterday. The first thing I did (after installing Windows) was to run a backlight test as I had been burned on a previous Asus laptop which this was meant to replace.

However, I can see that on the right of the screen there seems to be some backlight bleed and while I admit I could being too harsh, I feel for nearly Â£2500 I can have those high standards. Also, the trackpad seems a little loose on the right corner.  For comparison, I tested it against the Macbook 2021 16"" my work supplied me and it has no backlight bleed or trackpad issue whatsoever.

My plan is to get Dell to refund me in full (as my statutory rights in the UK dictate I can) but before I do that I just want to find out if this is something that you have to deal with when buying an XPS, or do people have units without these issues? Maybe I'm being a bit OCD about it but I don't find these issues on Mac products and while the logical position might be to just buy a Mac, I can't stand OSX.

Admittedly, if I get a refund I'm not sure what else I could get that would be of an equivalent spec. I guess I would be happier having a cheaper laptop with issues than a expensive one. The money is what bothers me here."

Inspiron 3501 Wont Boot. (Possible Monitor Problem)
"First off. I am speechless that a monitor issue renders these new dell laptops completely useless, because of the pre-boot check. If no monitor is detected it just does not Boot.....Very anti-consumer and a great source for more E-waste. What a Joke.

But anyway, I'm fixing a friends Inspiron. Its about maybe 1-3 years old. She claims it was never damaged. Its showing 2 orange then 7 white Led blinks (Which is LCD Failure). I opened it up, and it looks brand new inside. Proceeded to reseat all the cables. But still the same Post Error Code. I'm worried that if I get a new screen for $100 that it may not fix the problem. Also the laptops value is only around 300-400 so it's not worth it if the new screen doesn't solve it. I looked at the eDP cable too but nothing seems damaged or any sign of wear is visible. 

Dells is absolutely no help. So I'm throwing the Hail Mary Here. If anyone has any advice it would be much appreciated."
"My Inspiron AIO screen text looks bad, is it normal?"
" Hello all, not sure if this has a solution but I least I would know the reason of it.

I just bought a Dell All-in-one (Inspiron AIO DT 5410) with Windows 11, and I'm noticing the screen just does not look good. It's specially noticeable in small text, where some letters have different thickness than others, and it just does not look sharp, feeling somewhat pixelated, and fuzzy (but not blurry), to the point that sometimes it gets hard to read. I can't really show it because it's just how it's perceived from the outside, a screenshot will just look ok in other device.

It's hard to describe, and a pic with my phone does not look exactly how bad it looks, but here are a couple in case anyone has seen something similar (notice the ""d"" is thicker than others, and the ""l"" look different from each other):  
[https://imgur.com/Sc7ebAz](https://imgur.com/Sc7ebAz)  
[https://imgur.com/JDwgBC9](https://imgur.com/JDwgBC9)

I've tried the Windows ClearType tool, but it looks bad in any choice (some worse than others, but still bad). I have of course updated all drivers for the Dell stuff and the Nvidia card as well. The screen resolution is set correctly (fullhd) and can't see any other setting that could affect it. It's really frustrating because being an all-in-one I can't just change to a different screen.

I know All-in-ones are basically laptops, so... is this just because the screen itself is bad quality? Or could something software related improve it, like graphic settings or something?

Thanks so much for your help!"

XPS 13 9310 Fingerprint Not Available
"**\[SOLVED\]**

After installing some Windows 10 and system updates last month, the Fingerprint sign-in suddenly stopped working.

Sign-in options says, ""This option is currently unavailable,"" and in yellow, ""We couldn't find a fingerprint scanner compatible with Windows Hello Fingerprint.""

Any tips?

TPM 2.0 still appears to be present in the Device Manager.

Oh, Dell. Always, so close, yet, so far.

**Edit**, just restarted again after attempting and failing the Goodix fingerprint driver install, and now it's working and Goodix fingerprint shows in Device manager. Curious."

DO NOT share a docking station - the correct way to share IO devices
"There are so many repeat requests had been asking the same issue or trying to do the same thing - want to sharing  a docking station for multi systems or laptops.   

such as this recent link found:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/yosk9n/will\_my\_theoretical\_thunderbolt\_docking\_setup\_work/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/yosk9n/will_my_theoretical_thunderbolt_docking_setup_work/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Most of the docking stations found currently in the market DO NOT have multi upstream connections for connecting to multi systems.  A docking station regardless what core technology is based on is designed for provide single system/laptop system to have multi I/O ports, such as video ports, USB ports, LAN port, audio, SD card and even with some by-pass down-stream ports or power port. 

So, don't try to share your docking station with multi PC or laptop systems at the same time. 

The correct solution should  be putting a docking station between your system/ laptop and a KVM switch.  And connected all the sharing devices, such as monitor(s), keyboard, mouse, USB DAC, WebCam, microphone, speaker or even external USB hub  to the KVM switch you pick."

Okay to upgrade my GPU to RTX 3060 on my Dell G5 5000?
"A couple of years ago. I bought the now discontinued Dell G5 5000. It came with a Dell OEM Nvidia RTX 2060 6GB GDDR6 GPU, an Intel i7-10700 CPU, 16 GB of RAM, and a 500W proprietary Power Supply. However, despite the fact that Nvidia has recommended a 550W Power supply for the 30 series, there was a more expensive version of my computer with the same 500W PSU, yet they had an RTX 3060 Ti 8GB GDDR6 in them.

I'm looking to upgrade my GPU, but I was wondering if the Dell OEM RTX 3060 Ti is the best/only option? Maybe they configured it to work well with my specs, whereas name brands such as MSI or EVGA put out general GPUs?"

Fixed it last night, and noticed this morning my Fn keys no longer work properly. I can't enable Fn-lock so the keys work for media/volume/brightness/etc. rather than standard F keys.

   * `sudo fwupdmgr get-updates`
   * `sudo fwupdmgr update`
* Install fprintd:
   * `sudo apt install fprintd`
* Install driver dependencies and driver itself:
   * `sudo apt install git`
   * `sudo apt install python3-pip`
   * `wget` [`http://nz2.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/o/openssl/libssl1.1_1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.16_amd64.deb`](http://nz2.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/o/openssl/libssl1.1_1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.16_amd64.deb)

Please Help - RAM Upgrade Options Inspiron 7791
"Hello,

I am trying to figure out what RAM I can get for my girlfriends Inspiron 7791 laptop. It currently has 16GB of 2666hmz RAM that it came with. I was originally going to put 32GB of 3200mhz RAM in it but the Intel 10510U processor it has maxes out at 2933mhz. I had two questions:

Will the BIOS allow a 2933mhz set of ram to run at that speed, or will it be locked to 2666?

Also, the Dell spec sheet for this model says that the laptop has a maximum capacity of 16GB of RAM. I have not heard of this limitation before, will it really not run with 32GB? Is there anyone else with the same/similar 7000 series who has made the change to 32 or 64GB who can verify?

Precision 5550 - A LOT of memory failures
"Over the last 2-4 weeks I had, from time to time, some random crashes in all kind of browsers (firefox, chrome, chromium, vivaldi). It was usually when I processed a website with some media content or other memory intensive content. The crashes happened more often, so I checked the kernel and always had 

    segfault

Curios. 

Today it was a nightmare: other applications start to crash randomly, including dpkg while installing upgrades and gnome at all. So I thought to execute a memtest (memtestx86) and the result is pretty bad...  
After 10000 errors it aborted with too many errors. Most of the errors look like

I will call pro support tomorrow, but still I would like to know: Is this kind of behaviour typical for RAM dying? Can I somehow, without deinstalling one bank (I have 2x32G) running the test ..., find out which bank is broken? Or may it be something else like the mainboard?

XPS 13 9343 - Laptop randomly goes to sleep after replacing battery
"I replaced the battery in my XPS 13 9343 a few days ago due to bloating issue.

The new battery is an aftermarket battery is not official dell battery.

The batttery works, however I'm running into an odd issue I'm using the laptop while plugged in (and at full charge), it would go to sleep randomly, I would see the windows blue screen before it goes to sleep, citing low battery for the reason why it's going to sleep.

This is really odd because:

1. My laptop is plugged in, why would the laptop think there's a lack of power if it's plugged in?
2. The battery is at 100% capacity when I get this problem

Did I get a bad battery or do I just need to use the battery more for the laptop to ""get used to"" the new battery? I could buy a new one but I'd rather not have to go through the annoying process of replacing it again."

"We've recently started ordering Dell 5570 laptops and are using them with WD19 docking stations, and a number of users are having issues with the external monitors staying connected or being available. 

In most cases, it takes several connect/disconnect/reconnect attempts with the USB-c cable from the dock to get them to show anything on the monitors. This happens routinely when either waking from sleep, or connecting in the office first thing after the laptop was sleeping. 

We also have a few users whose monitors ""freak out"" and go into input cycling mode for 30 seconds to a minute several times a day, without warning, while in use. 

This has also happened to a few 9430 latitudes, but is far less of a problem on those.

Inspiron 7375 - no network adapter if plugged in on boot
"This is an odd issue, and mostly an annoyance. When I power up (either a cold start, or from hibernation) or restart, if the computer is plugged in, there's no network adapter (no networks available, and adapter doesn't show in Device Manager. If I power back down and have it unplugged on power-up, the adapter magically reappears. This occurs with the original Dell adapter, as well as two non-OEM adapters (one of which is USB-C).

Any idea what's actually going on, and how to remedy it?"
Charger Help
"So I recently purchased the Dell G15 5521 SE and it uses a 240Watt charger. Now the charger comes with a 16Amp plug whose charging sockets are only at selective plug points. So is there any way where I can buy a simple 3 pin adapter and what wattage or amps adapter should I get? And will using that adapter damage my laptop?

Charging Dell Inspiron 16 Question
"Hi, I purchased the Dell Inspiron 16 which came with a USB C power adapter. To use my Hama docking station, I plug my Dell power adapter into the power port of the docking station and then a Thunderbolt quality cable to my laptop USB-C/TB port. I am getting warning messages that I may be limited on the performance based on the low power I am using. It does charge the machine; however, I don't like the warnings. Is this a problem and what is a better solution?"

"Need help with Dell precision, graphics card"
"I recently bought a new graphics card for my dell precision. I need to get the drivers installed. Every time I try to install it the GeForce installer says I do not have compatible hardware. I have the card plugged in. the issue is that I cannot use the display above the graphics card while the graphics card is plugged in. So if I want to try to install the drivers itâ€™s going to make me have the graphics card plugged in. If itâ€™s plugged in then how do I see what Iâ€™m doing?

Nvidia Graphics Driver on Dell Inspiron 5482
"I am a little confused. I have an Inspiron 5482 that I bought back in 2019. When I go to my graphics card and update the driver, it says it is already the latest driver.

\[Specifically UHD graphics 620. When I google ""can I update hte driver"" the response is:

"" No, because Intel UHD graphics 620 is integrated with your Intel core i3 or i5 processor. So **for upgrading the graphics card you need to change your processor itself**."" It says I cannot update this. ie I am stuck with it.\]

However, when I go to the Dell driver site and type: ""Nvidia"" it looks like I can download the preferred driver on this computer. I realize I may be confusing the hardware itself with the driver, but I am not in the mood to wreck my device so I am looking for confirmation. It seems like it would solve all the problems with photoshop lagging and crashing. I realize this device is not the ideal one to run photoshop, but it has 8GB of ram and I am not doing incredibly high resolution billboards with it.

I want to recover my BIOS on a Model before 2015 on a product with expired warranty
"I have problems and I would like to recover my old BIOS version. I went to see how to do it on the dell website and they said since my model is before 2015 (Vostro 3900) I have to contact support and get the recovery file from there. When I went to the site I found out my warranty has expired so I couldn't get in direct contact with the support. So is there a way I could recover my BIOS? Thank you!

If you want to find out my pc problems that are the reason I am lookin for a BIOS recovery I'm going to list them here. Don't read it otherwise : ). My mic/headphone jacks aren't working (static on the headphones and no input on the mic). It says that my usb ports are using too much memory and I can't print with my usb connected printer. Very often I get artifacts and my screen turns black for a second randomly. When I shake around anything plugged in the pc that seems to trigger the screen going black. Thank you!"

AIO 3475 - Power LED always ON
"Morning all,

I am working on an AIO 3475 and just replaced the motherboard. After reassembling the components and plugging in to test i noticed that the Power LED (bottom right corner) was illuminated immediately after plugging in the power cord but without pressing the power button.

When the switch is pressed power seems to be applied as the fans are spinning up. Unfortunately that's as far as it goes. No video, no beep codes, no amber LED.

I've tried to remove the CMOS battery, as mentioned by some other power related threads, and holding the power button for 30 seconds. This didn't have any effect.

Any advice?"

For context, I have a Dell XPS 9510 and I do not have any other power plan except balanced. Yes, i could create them, but why I wanted to see those plans was because of the ""High performance...ultra performance plans""

Which brings the question, does your laptop performance get like limited because of the power manager or MyDell app? Does it affect games?. Im not an expert in these things which is why i am askinh"

u2722d monitor disconnecting and blinking problem
"Hello!

I have a problem with my u2722d monitor but I'm not sure if it's supposed to be like this or not. Every time I turn it off(by using the button on its back) it's as if it gets disconnected from my computer. The computer stops detecting the monitor and re-assembles the monitors so the icons and windows get moved to a different monitor. When I turn it on again it tries to assemble everything back and it blinks a few times as well as if it's the first time it's detecting the monitor. Is it supposed to be like this? If not, is there a way to fix this so that it doesn't have to re-detect the monitor every time I turn it on?

XPS 15 9570 speakers fix
"I always thought the speakers on this laptop and the drivers for the speakers were trash. But today, I've found a piece of software that has made the speakers on this laptop more than decent and figured I would share it for anyone else with bad speakers on the Dell XPS 15 9570. This should work for other laptops as well, but attempt this at your own risk.

Some things to note before I jump into the software I used: 

* I did a fresh install of Windows 11 to fix all the bugs that were with the earlier versions of Windows 11, **so I don't know if this will work on Windows 10 or past versions**. 
* I am also currently on the Realtek(R) Audio drivers and did not install any Dell audio drivers.

I used two programs: 

* Equalizer software called Equalizer APO (Install this first)
* Peace Equalizer (basically an interface for APO)

Once both are installed, launch Peace and install it for the Realtek(R) Audio Speakers/Headphones.

Click on the 'Classic' preset on the bottom left and increase the Pre Amplifying to 5, and your speakers should sound 100 times better and louder than whatever it was previously (at least for me).

I hope this helps!"

Canâ€™t exit Built-in Self-Test (BIST) on my DELL Inspiron AIO 7775 after Display Replacement
"Hello guys,

i am using a DELL Inspiron 7775 AIO Computer. 

Unfortunately my display broke (at least only in one corner) and I got an identical display via Aliexpress.

Now comes the crazy...
I have replaced the display and when I turn on the computer, the computer shows me only the colors white, red, green and blue - and that in continuous loop (i think its the Built-in Self-Test). I cant boot anything.

See in Video here:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mjz2q4WdVgXM8IasSXaik1PJhZBwW785/view?usp=drivesdk

To rule out a problem with the connections or the display cable, I put the old display back in and it works without any problems. I have done it 4-5 Times with the same result.

What I did:

- Updated the BIOS to the latest version.
- installed all new drivers available from DELL for this model

I just don't know what to do anymore.
The display I received is the same display, an LM270WR3 SSA1 from LG.

I would be happy if anyone here could help me with this problem!


Kind regards

Old XPS Tower - Stuck Booting Up
"I have an old old old Dell XPS 2006 (I think..) tower. Big metal one. It is running Windows XP on a regular HDD.

I set it up for my Dad to use the internet on, but now it is stuck on booting up. The power LED stays orange instead of green, the fans remain super high, when normally they only do this for a second or two until Windows is finished booting. After the initial BIOS (?) Black screen loading bar, the screen remains black. Never makes it to the Windows logo or screen.

Any ideas what could be wrong? I mainly want to fix it to get the saved stuff off of the HDD. Thanks!"
Vostro 7620 fan runs non-stop
"I purchased a Vostro 7620 a while back. It's the first computer I've owned that runs the fan non-stop while in operation. It's relatively quiet and not horribly annoying - I'm just wondering if it's normal?

Windows 11 / 16 G RAM / 1T storage  / i7 / 64 bit

Nothing taxing in processes.

Thanks in advance."
How to enable secure boot in dell bios?
"I'm new to technology, so I just wanted to ask how you guys enabled secure boot in the bios. When I enable it, it still remains disabled. Sorry and Thank you for answering this question of mine.

My fan doesn't spin as fast on Linux
"I have an Inspiron 3583 which has an Intel Core i5-8265U and integrated Intel UHD 620 + hybrid AMD Radeon 520 Graphics.

When playing games on Linux, my fan doesn't spin as fast as on Windows. Whenever I play games on Windows with the Radeon 520 the fan spins very loudly. On Linux it's almost quiet and gets a lower frame rate. It's even more quiet than when using the Intel UHD 620 integrated graphics on Windows."
I had it all working until I Uninstaller the TB software - Layitude 7490 + WD19TB
"Display port on two 1080p monitors. I was getting weird flickering, like a device was being unplugged, so I updated BIOS on laptop, firmware on dock, TB controller on laptop. Everything good, until a reboot and got a message about thunderbolt software no longer needed - I'm like okay, Uninstall TB

Now TB Control Center doesn't show the dock connected.

Device manager is clean, no yellow flags or unknown devices

Unplugged everything, did the power button on the dock for 30 sec to drain it

Rebooted laptop without anything attached. I get a blip noise like a new decice has been connected, but pretty sure that's just device being charged - although, I can't be sure

I read there is a Microsoft update that might be a problem - it's a corporate laptop, has bit locker active

Everything was working!?!?!??!!?

Ugh.

Any help appreciated"

Dell 5820 tower starting issue
"  

Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

I bought my dell tower with the top build parts last year(2021).

Today, it suddenly can not start as usual.

I followed the online technical service to reset the power by unplugging the power and pressing the power button for the 20s.

It works the first time, then I keep working with my workstation for a day.

Then suddenly it can not start again, this time getting worse. I can not start the workstation by resetting the power.

And Dell promises to send a technician to help. for your information, I have waited from Thursday 3rd Nov until 8st Nov 2021 to get a technician to help.

Dell sends the motherboard to the technician and asks them to replace it, however, workstation 5820 is not the regular type of Dell product, and the technicians are not trained to disassemble the machine. 

So the technician decided to help me test data rather than tearing the machine apart, which might cause extra damage.

The reason that technician doesn't suggest I replace the motherboard was due to two reasons.

First, Dell didn't send the motherboard properly, and the part might have already been damaged from transition(the technician showed me the part of the motherboard already split),

Second, the technician didn't train to replace this particular type of device and he told me most Dell technicians didn't train to fix this complex type of device, so there was no technician who would answer this case, which keep me waiting longer than usual.

I asked him what if the problems happen again, and what would he suggest I do with it. He told me the better way is to send the workstation back to Dell and let a professional run the test for it.

After the data test, everything seems ok and the technician helps me to reset the power and sleep mode from hybrid to regular mode, which he assumes might cause the abnormal start problem.

After he has gone, the workstation works normally for days.

Today the problem shows again, I went to Dell's website and the online assistant told me they will send technician to help.

Can you all see the problems of this?

1. Assistants can not figure out what might be the problem.

2. Online assistant decided to send a technician who does not know how to deal with this kind of device.

3. Online service told me I can not send the device back to Dell(they only accept laptops for this), which is what their onsite technician suggest I ask Dell for a box to send it back if the problem happened again.

4. Technicians don't know how to disassemble the device to replace the motherboard might cause damage to the workstation, also the motherboard is already damaged from the transition. Who should be responsible if the data from the workstation damaged by this unthoughtful action?

I suggested all my friends and family pick Dell as their first choice before. I've changed my mind at this moment.

I spent more than $5000 to expect a better sales service, not like this.

Here is the quote for my 5820 towers.

Maybe someone from the community can help me to find out what might cause the starting problem.

Also, I would like to hear any suggestions from you about how should communicate with Dell.

XPS 17 9710 internet connectivity issues
"Hi all - I'm seeking some advice on some network connectivity issues I have recently started noticing on my XPS 17 9710 laptop.  I purchased this laptop about a year ago, and only began encountering these issues a few weeks ago.

Every couple of minutes or so, my internet connection has been dropping, reconnecting, dropping again, etc.  I've confirmed that these issues are linked to this laptop, and not an issue with my ISP, router, etc. - other devices maintain a constant connection.

My network adapter is the Killer(R) Wi-Fi 6 AX1650s 160MHz Wireless Network Adapter (201D2W) that came with the laptop.  Based on some online research I've done on this issue, it seems that this network adapter (and/or some of its settings) is often suspected of causing these types of internet connectivity issues, but I was not sure if any definitive solution had been identified.

Has anyone else run into this, and found a solution that works consistently?  This was not a cheap purchase, and I am otherwise quite happy with the laptop, but these internet issues are a bit disappointing, and I'm hoping there is a fix.

Many thanks for any suggestions!"

nvme upgrade
"Looking to put a WD blue sn570 2TB in the i7573 to replace and size upgrade the current 1TB sata.  I tried to do this with a Sabrent Rocket, but their clone program didn't work with an outboard C box, so I just used it to upgrae the nvme in my asus gamer.  Just wondering if anyone knows which clone software comes with WD.  I used whatever came with the 1TB sata card to upgrade it from the native 512GB with no issues.  The asus clone used the second slot onthe motherboard, whereas the i7573 only has the one m.2 slot and a separate 2.5 bay, currently occupied by a 2TB ssd."

Audio capabilities on my XPS 8930
"I bought this is early 2020 so it's a 2019 model.

Audio card:   Integrated Realtek ALC3861 High Definition Audio 

From what I hear it's pretty crappy. I was thinking of connecting to an AVR. There seems to be only one output connector but it claims to be 7.1 sound. What kind of cable runs from one connector and produces sound from 7.1 channels? 

Should I be looking at a USB external or internal card DAC like a Sound Blaster instead?

Thoughts or experiences? TIA."
Dell Inspiron 3280 AIO boots to Dell logo screen but does not go any further. Cannot access BIOS or boot menus. Possibly bricked?
"So I recently attempted to switch my Dell Inspiron 3280 to Ubuntu. Ubuntu installed fine, and I was able to actually power down and power it back up normally. However, upon restarting the computer again, it would no longer boot and would freeze on the dell logo screen, completely unresponsive to any kind of input. I have tried contacting Dell but they immediately labeled my request as ""completed"", most likely because I switched the OS from Windows to a non-supported OS. I have tried the following and they all yield the exact same result (except for the last one):

* Unplugging all peripherals and disconnecting power, holding power button for 30 seconds, then reconnecting the power and trying to boot
* Unplugging the HDD and trying to boot
* Disconnected CMOS battery from the main board for 15 minutes, plugged it back in, and tried to boot.
* Following the steps to clear the CMOS settings (This resulted in the computer turning on with no dell logo for about 10 to 15 seconds, then turning off, then turning back on again, and getting stuck on the dell logo screen again)

I get the feeling I most likely bricked the system. To be honest, it's an older computer we had laying around and I won't be upset if there's nothing I can do to fix it, breaking things is part of the learning process. I do have a different computer which I use as my main computer and I do still have the USB I used for the Ubuntu installation as well (just in case that info comes in handy). Any advice or help would be appreciated as Dell seems to not want to answer my support requests because I tried to change the OS."
[XPS15] Battery Drain in Sleep (*not* Modern Standby?)
"I've been looking into this and as someone who also has a MacBook (for work), it's extremely annoying.

First, I tried disabling Modern Standby. I did the registry hack, but it doesn't work, it disables sleep completely. I don't have an option to disable S0 in bios (apparently got removed with some update).

So I decided to try to debug it. Running \`powercfg /SleepStudy\`, I saw something really interesting: my problem is not that the device is randomly waking from sleep, but rather it just drains while in sleep.

I have a 52hr-long sleep state that drained 74% of battery. That's 1.4% per hour, in sleep!? What in tarnation! My Mac would drain \*maybe\* 5-10% in that time.

Is this normal? Do I have a dud? Is there anything I can do about it?

Weird Return Label
"Just initiated a return for a monitor and received about 26 emails from FedEx with different shipping labels. They're all going to a company called ""Ivy Tech"" with a phone number of ""1234567891."" I was expecting the return to go to Dell.

Has anyone ever seen this before? Dell chat and phone support does not know who Ivy Tech is, but whenever they re-send the label it has the same recipient info."

Which docking station for G5 5587?
"I wish to connect it to two external S2722QC monitors.

However, OP had different monitors and it's been two years since the question's been asked.  


The monitors are 4K 3840x2160. I'd ideally want to achieve 60Hz on both monitors if possible."
Dell XPS 15 9520 on a 65 Wh Docking Station
"I would love to buy the current Dell XPS 15 9520. 

In our office, we've got Lenovo 65 Wh docking stations all over the place, which is way below Dells own power adapters. As we have shared desks, I would like to avoid taking the power adapter with me all day. 

Question: 

Any of you tried the Dell XPS 15 and in which configuration on a 65 Wh docking station? Does it work at all and if yes, how does it perform? 

Is it worth to go for the smaller i5 which I can get with onboard graphics, or are the problems the same and I can go directly for the i7 with GeForce graphics?"
"Inspiron G5 5587, two S2722QC, HD22Q, stuck at 30Hz"
"I got a problem connecting my Inspiron G5 5587 to S2722QC monitors using the HD22Q Dual Charge Dock.Â   


Everything seems to be working when I connect one S2722QC to my Inspiron G5 5587 via USB-C and the other S2722QC via HDMI 2.0. The USB-C connected S2722QC is at 59.997Hz (not a problem), and the one connected via HDMI 2.0 is getting 60Hz. Both S2722QC are 4K 3840x2160. Great!  


However, when I try to connect my Inspiron G5 5587 to the HD22Q, the maximum Hz is stuck at 30Hz. I am aware that it will not be possible to use USB-C from my HD22Q to charge my Inspiron G5 5587, yet, I want to make sure that it is possible to connect the two monitors using HD22Q and get 3840x2160 and 60Hz. I admit that I'm not yet entirely sure if it's not working due to the cables HDMI to HDMI and DisplayPort to HDMI (bought a couple from Amazon, and I'm not convinced if they are what they claim to be...).Â   


The question I have is thus theoretical, is it possible to connect everything I've lined up so that the two S2722QC are 4K at 60Hz? Or would I be ""happier"" with a different docking station? I am looking for a sweet little set up using the two monitors I have and the G5 5587 (if possible, since it's in relatively good condition and would want it to last a couple more years).   


If it is possible, I will go to a proper electronics shop and search for the cables to make sure that they are compatible (Amazon has really disappointed me with the quality of their products). I just want to ensure that I'm not fighting with windmills here, and it's simply impossible to connect everything the way I intended."
Dell U2720Q - Power Issues with HDMI Input?
"I have three Dell U2720Q monitors that I purchased a couple years ago. All three seem to have an issue with the HDMI input. The main observations are:

1. The monitor will randomly go black, requiring a power cycle to get the monitor to turn back on. As far as the computer is concerned, the monitor still looks to be connected, but the monitor is otherwise black
2. Often times, when the computer goes to sleep the monitor does not go in to power-save mode, but rather stays on with just a black screen and the backlight on

When I originally purchased these monitors I experienced this. Not realizing it was specific to just the HDMI inputs, and since the monitors were brand new, I went through the RMA process for two of the monitors. However, both the new monitors had the same issue.

I have described this in more detail on the dell forums here:

[Re: U2720Q, three, two PC's, randomly go black - Dell Community](https://www.dell.com/community/Monitors/U2720Q-three-two-PC-s-randomly-go-black/m-p/7684022#M128918)

And it seems I'm not the only one, e.g.:

[Re: U2720Q, randomly turning off the screen - Dell Community](https://www.dell.com/community/Monitors/U2720Q-randomly-turning-off-the-screen/m-p/8296799#M144356)

&#x200B;

In my experience, this is only an issue on the HDMI inputs. It has occurred on every monitor I've used. I've tested this with a number of different HDMI cables as well as different machines (two different dell laptops, a thinkpad laptop, and two different custom-built desktops).

Ultimately, I switched to using the DP inputs and USB-C input, neither of which have shown this behavior, and moved on, otherwise happy with the monitors.

I now find myself in a situation where I need access to the HDMI inputs, though. There seems to be no indication from Dell that this is a known issue, and I don't see any firmware updates anywhere available for these monitors.

I assume that this point I'm out of luck, but I'm curious if there are any options here I'm missing in terms of resolving this issue."
How do I find out if my USB-C port supports DP-ALT mode?
"I'm trying to run a monitor from the USB-C port.  I have an Anker USB-C to HDMI adapter, but when I plug it into my new 2nd monitor and attempt to detect it, it doesn't detect it.

Dell 27 inch 165hz 1440p refresh rate issues
"I recently bought a new monitor - Dell 27 curved 165hz - which I intended to use as a second monitor on my laptop. 
However, I saw that with the hdmi cable that I got the monitor will only run at 120hz (checked with ufo fps test) even if I set it to run on 144hz on nvidia control panel. 120hz is also the refresh rate for my laptop.
As for ports, on the laptop I have a hdmi 2.0 port and an usb c port (usb3.2 gen1) which I read that cannot be used to connect external display devices :(.
Now the question is why is my monitor running 120 hz instead of 144 or even the whole 165? I read that hdmi 2.0 should be able to do 240hz at 1080p."

one 450 gb SSD - Hard Drive 2

and 1TB HDD - Hard Drive 3.

I was doing my business as usuall, when my pc suddenly shut off and I got this message:

""self monitoring system has reported that a parameter has exceeded its normal operating range""

It said that I can press F12 to run the diagnostics, I ran the diagnostics and it showed me this message:

Hard Drive 0 - S/N 10282221E0334, Incorrect status = 3E

SMART Predictive Failure.

Error Code: 2000-0151

I checked the S/N Number and it corresponds with Hard Drive 0, my boot SSD, not the one I added recently but the one what was working fine since the begginging. I installed HDTune and CrystalDynamics, and both softwares show that health of my SSDs and HDD are fine. Boot SSD, the one that is ""failing"" shows 98% health and all indicators on CrystalDynamics are OK. I also ran a test on HDTune of particularly ""failing"" SSD and it went OK.

I went into BIOS and changed the boot orderd of the drives and error stopped showing on boot.

After not understading what is going on, I installed ""Dell Support Assist"" and ""Inter Driver & Support Assist"". Both showed that I needed an update toward ""Intel Rapid Storage Technology Driver"". I instlled that update, and changed boot order back to normal.

After restarting PC two times error not showing up anymore.

The question is, is my SSD failing or about to fail, or it was an driver issue?"

Is the WD22TB4 really worth it?
"I have the wd19 and I have a windows laptop and a macbook pro that I use on daily basis.

Long story short if I want the dual monitors to work through the docks, I need to update my dock station to a one that has extra TB ports.

My current dock really bothers me because of the fan noise and occasionally some chaotic behavior with multi-displays.

My question is for the owners of WD22TB4, is it really better? Is it worth it? 

I don't want to feel stupid buying the latest dock and then have the same issues later."
Work computer recommendations
"The current laptop I have is starting to slow down and is giving me more problems lately. My boss is letting me pick out a laptop that best suits my needs. Problem is that I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m looking for when it comes to laptops. 

I work in industrial electrical. We do a lot of Microsoft 365 as well as AutoCAD and Siemens/Allen Bradley PLC software. Iâ€™ve seen laptops that look like theyâ€™re a tablet with a detachable keyboard. Something like that would be nice for taking pictures and readings, but I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s even possible. 

Any recommendations would be really appreciated."

Dell Studio 540 PSU upgrade problem
 I'm currently trying to replace an old dell PSU (Liteon PS-6351) with a Corsair CS450M. The System will not post when I have the corsair plugged in but will when I reinstall the old psu. I have also tried an EVGA BQ650 and it still wouldn't boot. The Motherboard is a IPIEL-RN2 with a Core 2 Quad 9400. I believe that this should be normal atx power and the ports all plug in fine. Is there anything I'm not seeing here? Thanks!

Dell rep converted my points to cash without asking me!
"Hey guys,

So I was speaking to Dell rep earlier about a technical issue with my account that didn't even get sorted in the end, that was unrelated, so I won't bore you with the details. Just after the chat ended though I noticed that most of points on my account were gone! After doing a bit of searching I noticed that they had been converted to Dell cash bearing in mind I didn't even talk to rep about points I'm pretty perplexed by this. I'm not looking want to buy anything from Dell until at least the spring next year having Dell cash that expires in February is pretty useless to me. Is there any way I can convert the cash back to points or should I just talk to another rep and try and get them to convert the cash back to points? Considering I didn't even ask for the points to be converted it seems unfair that I'm stuck with this cash. 

Thanks in advance for any advice."

XPS 13 stuck on Dell logo
"I have a Dell XPS 13 that when I boot up, gets stuck on the Dell logo screen that you see prior to booting.

UK AW3423DW beware
Is Dell Customer really that bad one cannot even ask for a product inquiry?
"Is anyone running Linux on an ""9310"" XPS 13?"
"I have a ticket open with Dell for this already, but in the meantime want to see if anyone else can corroborate this issue.

Have Ubuntu 22.04 (HWE kernel `5.15.0-52-lowlatency`) on this machine, and I'm having weird behaviour with the charger.

If I boot the machine with the charger plugged in, it will subsequently **never** detect when it is unplugged (still shows as plugged in, but battery discharging), which means power saving policy based on the state of the charger never activates (ie, sleep when shutting the lid).

(The machine still charges / discharges correctly and the front LED shows the correct charging state so it appears to be a firmware/software fault and not a hardware one, at least as far as I can tell)

If I boot the machine with the charger unplugged, everything behaves perfectly normally after plugging back in.

Have tested and confirmed this behaviour is consistent using a bunch of different USB-PD power sources across a range of manufacturers, both mains and battery power sources, and monitors with USB-C/USB-PD:

* Dell 45W charger that came with the laptop (model ""036HFH"")
* Dell 65W charger (model ""01N3PY"")
* Apple 90W charger
* [Anker 543 II](https://www.anker.com/products/a2046?variant=41268824932502&ref=collectionBuy) 45W charger
* [EcoFlow Delta](https://www.ecoflow.com/us/delta-portable-power-station) portable power station (100W capable)
* [Dell U3219Q](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/cty/pdp/spd/dell-u3219q-monitor) monitor (90W capable)
* [Lenovo P27h-20](https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/p/accessories-and-software/monitors/professional/61e9gat6uk) monitor (90W capable)

It seems to have persisted through a bunch of BIOS revisions too - currently running the latest 3.11.0, but remember this being an issue several versions ago (at least since 3.9.0, probably earlier) but I hadn't conclusively identified the trigger at that point.

Hoping to avoid downgrading through versions until I find the one that isn't affected (that is assuming that downgrading the BIOS even would downgrade the USB-PD firmware, which I doubt).

Any takers?"

No Realtek sound device in XPS 15 9560
"The Realtek audio device is missing for some reason and I can't figure it out. I have Win 10. There is no Realtek device listed in Device Manager. I only see Intel HD Audio, and if I plug in an HDMI cable then the laptop will produce sound through the TV speakers. Other than that, there is no sound at all. No audio device to select for default output or recording in the sound settings in Control Panel or any where else. I tried installing the audio driver offered by Dell but still no Realtek audio device appears in Device Manager. I also tried pressing F12 during boot to get a boot menu and selected the diagnostics option. No sounds are produced when I click on the Audio diagnostics button. I ordered a replacement audio board from eBay and replaced the one I had but still no sound. I've tried headphones but without a Realtek device I still get no sound. Looks like the internal speakers are plugged in properly but still no sound. Yes, I did check in the UEFI settings and confirmed that the audio system is enabled. All Windows updates and optional drivers have been installed. Can anyone offer a solution to get the sound working?"

consistent sound / microphone issues
"Hi all - 

Ever since I got this xps two years ago, I've had major issues with the sound.  I used a microphone that has a pin (headphone jack) for recording webinars - this worked on previous computers, and worked on a mac, but the volume is so low on my dell. I have tried two different pin type microphones, neither work. They both work perfectly on my phone. 

I tried them also with an adaptor that goes pin jack thing to usbc.  Still doesn't work. 

I also tried a rode podcasting mic that is usbc, that volume is way too low as well. 

I am beyond frustrated. I need a reliable microphone. Is it the waves audiomaxx that's the problem? Does anybody know what the problem is?

And does anybody have a high quality microphone that works with this stupid computer? I am beyond frustrated and Dell is useless in terms of support. 

Thank you"

XPS 13 (9370) won't charge from any USB-C port
"My XPS 13 9370, purchased in 2018, will no longer charge when the AC adapter is plugged into any of its USB ports.

Up until a month ago, the laptop was usually plugged into power using one of the two USB-C ports on the left side. One of the ports then stopped detecting the power adapter, so I moved to using only the working one. Then a week ago, it was possible only to charge using the single port on the right side. Now, the laptop does not respond to the charger being connected on any of the 3 ports (2 left and 1 right).

Battery health is reported in the BIOS as Excellent, and no power adapter is detected in the BIOS view, regardless of which USB-C port I plug the power adapter or charger into.

Steps I have taken:

* tried all 3 USB-C ports for charging
* verified that the Dell power adapter is working (it will charge other USB-C devices I have, including a MacBook)
* tried using another USB-PD power adapter and cable (an Anker 735, and also the Apple 30W USB-C charger
* Force restarted the laptop by holding the power button for 30 seconds
* Re-flashed the latest BIOS (when I was still able to charge on one port), version 1.21
* Disconnected the battery and held the power button for 30 seconds, then reconnected the battery
* Reset the CMOS by disconnecting and reconnecting the CMOS battery
* Run the pre-boot diagnostic checks at every stage, and it keeps failing to detect the power adapter on any port

Other than not being able to detect any USB-PD charger being connected, the laptop appears to be working fine. Of course if I have no way to charge the battery, once that runs out it's going to be pretty dead. The machine is 4 years old and out of warranty, so I'm not optimistic on getting much support from Dell.

My guess is that the USB-PD controller is somehow broken and can no longer draw power to charge the battery, but perhaps I've missed something or guessed wrong?"

New Battery Not Detected Dell G7 7590 Laptop
"I have a Dell G7 7590, which has had its problems over the years. I noticed the battery needed a replacement so I ordered a new one: https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B08HMKF814?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_image

So I unscrew the backcover, remove the old battery, and install the new one. I turned the laptop on with only battery power, and it was running more slowly than normal. When I finally got to my desktop, it said that the battery was not detected, and there were now 4 amber 1 white lights blinking on the side (Apparently that means there is a battery problem, no shit Dell). Also, now my keyboard was almost completely unresponsive.

I thought maybe I fucked up something on the motherboard during instillation. So I took out the battery and ran it with just AC power. It worked fine and the keyboard was responsive again. So I guess its just the battery? 

After that I opened up the laptop and tried plugging in the battery again, but it was the same problem. No battery detected, and the keyboard is unresponsive. Am I that inept at plugging the battery connector in, or is it a faulty replacement battery? Any suggestions?

I've only opened a laptop up once before to apply thermal paste so I'm not that advanced. But when I did that had no problems."

Max RAM question for Latitude 5300

I get better peformance on Battery than when plugged it

Absolutely disgusting customer care from Dell.
"So. I bought a laptop from Dell a month and a half ago. A G15 special edition blah blah blah. Wanted 32gb of ram so went as high spec as I could. 

It lasted two weeks before there was a hardware error. I had paid for the ""premium service"" so of course contacted them. After a few hours they decided the best thing to do would be to send me a replacement. I was frustrated with this because it was a relatively high end system and two weeks before an issue was fairly terrible to start but what can you do? Promised to have a replacement with me a week later. Went though all the hoops of photographing the computer to prove I had it etc etc. Agreed the replacement. Like for like. 

We are now four weeks later. No replacement. No updates other than the same regurgitated copy and paste responses. I have spent hours on the phone and hours on online chat and we still have no replacement and no updated replacement time. 

I have never ever had customer service like this, or the lack of it in my life. On Friday this week I was promised by a ""manager"" that I would be contacted by Monday with alternative replacement options. It's now Wednesday and silence despite emailing to ask yesterday. 
I cannot put into words how baffled I am by this.

I honestly don't know what to do. I'm a disabled man who bought this system to make my life easier. It has been literally a nightmare. I have a Â£1700 brick and dell have been nothing but terrible. Does anyone have any advice please?"

Question regarding S2721DGF and its refresh rate
"Hi!

Anyone with the monitor S2721DGF can runs it at 2k@165Hz with RGB and 10bpc (setup in Nvidia control panel)?

I've been struggling with mine for the past few days, changing cables, updating drivers, doing few other tests and i cannot get it to run the above config...  
These are the results I got with the tests:

\- 2k@165Hz YCbCr422 (Limited) 8bpc  
\- 2k@144Hz YCbCr422 (Limited) 10bpc  
\- 2k@120Hz RGB (Full) 8bpc  
\- 2k@60Hz RGB (Full) 10bpc

Right now, I'm using a Ugreen Displayport 1.4 cable, VESA certified, which should easily handle 2k@165Hz RGB 10bpc. I've tested others generic cables, all DP 1.4, as well and none could get to that specs. Also, as per RTings, this monitor should run what I'm seeking for (2k@165Hz RGB 10bpc). 

So, anyone could confirm it, please? Because I think I got faulty unit and thinking on sending it back to the RMA :(

Thanks in advance!"

"Problems connecting displays to WD22TB4 and a Macbook M1 pro 14"""
"Hello everyone. I got the dock today, and wanted to connect two monitors via DisplayPort to it and connect the dock via a single cable to a Macbook M1 pro. The dock has 2xDP ports and 1xHDMI port (my monitors support exactly those two). I bought that dock specifically because of the two DP ports, with the idea to connect both monitors to those ports and use in extended mode.  


The thing is, once I connect both monitors, they are mirrored. There's no option in MacOS to change the settings and it always shows only 1 monitor (I imagine because of the mirroring) in the Display settings. I looked through the manuals ([https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/product-support/product/wd22tb4-dock/docs](https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/product-support/product/wd22tb4-dock/docs)) and it doesn't say anything about mirroring. I've been going back and forth trying to figure out how to extend the displays, but I'm starting to think this is not possible.  


It's baffling to me why they would include two DP ports when monitors would be mirrored. Unless I'm doing something wrong.  


Please help."

Precision 3571 can't find RAM after running AIDA benchmark tool
"Hello

I bought Precision 3571 just 1 week ago. And I wanted to benchmark my laptop. So I used AIDA64 6.8. I read RAM information by clicking Motherboard->SPD item. After that I restarted my laptop and It didn't work normally. Let me explain in detail.Â 

1. It didn't boot the laptop and yellow and white led are blinking. (It means RAM error)
2. After a few seconds, it restarts the laptop automatically and enter to BIOS.
3. BIOS is showing warning message ""Alert! No memory was detected on previous boot."".Â 
4. After I click continue, then the laptop works normally.

This issue is happening 100% every time after running AIDA->SPD. If I do shutdown instead of restart, the laptop can't start. It only starts after long pressing the power button (reset).Â 

I am really worrying that if this is my motherboard or RAM, maybe other firmware or hardware issue? Or is it because of AIDA?Please help me give technical answers if anyone has any idea.

Beside this issue, my laptop is working well. My current OS is win11 build22h2.

The dell support agents didn't accept this as their product issue. So I couldn't refund the product. 

My intention is that to know if it is really Dell Precision 3571 issue or AIDA issue. **If anyone has same laptop please try AIDA and see if you have same issue.**Â This is very simple.

Thank you!

Best Regards

Oliver"

"Dell G15; first gaming laptop/pc in general, have had no issues with it except in a sprite-based game? Unsure how to fix"
"Okay so the game is Tactics Ogre Reborn, itâ€™s a remaster of an older game.

I havenâ€™t really used laptop yet for games but everything else itâ€™s seemed to have worked fine. My drivers are up to date and whatnot. And yet no one seems to have this problem with this game so Iâ€™ve put it down to my Dell G15 (is the i7, GeForce 3050 one).

The game is not particularly demanding so im unsure what it is thatâ€™s the problem with it? Iâ€™m also very new to pc gaming was hoping to use this as a gateway. Console gaming is just way easier to a noob like me lol but Iâ€™m hoping to learn. Any solutions?"

Suggestion for a compatible Docking Station for Inspiron 7391 2-in-1 Laptop
"Hi everyone, 

Im a bit of a loss and seeking advice. 

Bit of a background: I have a Dell Inspiron 7391 2-in-1 Laptop for private use and a HP Elitebook as a work laptop. Both support USB-C Thunderbolt. I also have 1 Lenovo Thinkvision monitor (2560 x 1140 QHD, 60Hz, 1 HDMI, 1xDP). I also have a keyboard, mouse and a Jabra headset.

Im searching for a compatible Docking Station for both. It doesnâ€™t have to be a Dell specific docking station, it can also be a universal docking station or another brand. I would like to power both laptops over the docking station (doesnâ€™t have to be at the same time), my monitor and periphery stuff. 

I also just bought a UGREEN 4- Port USB 3.0 Switch Box. 

Can you recommend any docking stations? Do I need one with the switch box? Can I use a docking station & Switch Box? 

I appreciate any help!"

Sent to repair
"EDIT:  Talked to dell.  The GPU has a corroded connector.  â€œUnintentional or accidental damage is not covered by your basic warrantyâ€. They are shipping me my machine back unfixed, since I did not wish to pay for repair.  I didnâ€™t want to remove my motherboard as to not void my warranty, but apparently it doesnâ€™t cover corrosion.  Whatever.  



Hello guys.  Iâ€™ve bought a dell G15 5515 around a year ago, and I had a basic warranty on it.  The GPU was not being recognized. After some troubleshooting of my own, I contacted dell support.  They troubleshooted, and deemed necessary to ship me a box to send them my laptop to repair.

I was under the impression that this was under my warranty, as there had been no discussion of cost until I received an invoice for a new motherboard, plus some diagnosing and and repair fees.

Iâ€™m not in a financial situation to buy a new motherboard, and I was under the impression that the diagnose fee would be covered by warranty.  If I get this shipped back without being repaired, am I still liable for fees incurred in the diagnoses category?  I donâ€™t want to be a Karen when I call support tomorrow.  

Overall I feel pretty upset that no representative from dell told me that my warranty didnâ€™t include motherboard replacement, as we had exhausted all other options before getting to this point.

Any insight is helpful.  Thank you!"
Dell G5 15 Boot Loop
"Hello All,

I have been on this all day and repeating online steps over and over and decided to ask here, hopefully someone may be able to help.

When I turn on the PC I see the Dell logo and the wheel at the bottom as usual, but instead of starting windows it just restarts again. It keeps doing this job-stop.

I have done:

1 - hard reset (remove internal battery and hold power button while unplugged for a minute then restarted again)

2- ran diagnostic from Bios - No issues besides batteries which is getting to the end of its life, but I always use plugged in

3 - started by clicking F12 and tried Dell support, ran a diagnostic from there without any issues. 

4- tried repairing and it says it was successful and restarts but keeps on the loop


Any ideas? I do not have another computer to do anything. I just donâ€™t understand why the loop. I keep doing the same thing over and over and that is the sedition of insanity.  Thank You!"

Dell Latitude 5430 overheating/throttling issues
"Am coming from a Dell Latitude 5420 (i7-1185G7) and bought a Dell Latitude 5430(i7-1265U). Extremely disappointed in Dell's poor thermal management. The 5420 worked just well with dual heat sinks and heating was never an issue. Regrettably, the 5430 only comes with a single thicker heat sink and the fan keeps going off plus throttling. Am not sure what the hell the quality control team is up to going for a single heat sink when both the u i7-1185G7 and i7-1265U consume the same power (latter even has 6 more cores). I previously had a Dell Latitude 5411 with single heat sink and the heating issue was present there as well. How is one suppose to make full use of the latest more powerful processor if it just ends up throttling down due to poor thermal management. Baffling. Someone please help me make sense of this mess, surely i must be missing something here."

Dell 5587 G5 - SSD port glitching?
"I think I've localised the problem to the SSD/SSD port. I'm not very tech savvy, but here's a rundown of my setup...

Samsung SSD 970 Evo - containing Windows 10, Programs and Documents

Toshiba MQ04ABF100 SATA - containing full backups of SSD. 

The problem I'm getting is that the whole laptop suddenly freezes up (sometimes mouse still working, sometimes mouse frozen) and it either shuts itself down or needs to be forced to power off. Powering it back on usually loads up the Dell Pre-Boot System check where it runs a scan. It completes, makes a horrible bleep, and tells me the hardware is good but will restart and install cSOS for recovery. 

The only way to reset the problem is to power off the system, unplug everything, open up the base, remove the SSD and put it back in again. 

The problem occurs randomly. There is not pattern in when it cuts out. Sometimes you get a warning when it is about to freeze if the audio suddenly sounds demonic. 

The only thing I can think it could be is that somehow the SSD glitches out. But all the connection points are fine (not grubby or rusted) and it's secured in with a screw and can't physically move. Samsung Magician scans all come back fine and the temperature never exceeds 70c. 

Any help would be gratefully appreciated."

2020 Dell XPS 17 Battery and GPU died from cold
"Hello all,

&#x200B;

Here to share an (apparently) rookie mistake experience with my 2020 XPS 17. I've had it ever since they came out with the model in the US market back in the summer 2020 and I've been loving it, even though the battery life has been lacking recently, as you'll see in the battery health in one of the screenshots.

&#x200B;

I live in a northern state, so it's naturally pretty cold here this time of year. I always bring my laptop with me to classes, and my backpack is always pretty heavy because I pack a bunch of stuff in it, and the laptop makes it even worse since it's a pretty heavy laptop. Last night I stayed at the college library to do some homework, but I only needed a notebook and a pen, so I decided to grab them, and leave my backpack with the rest of my stuff in my car. I left the backpack in the trunk of my car, because I didn't want anyone breaking a window of my car to steal my backpack. That was one of the main mistakes, because it's usually way colder in the trunk than in the cabin  It was in the trunk for a bit over three hours. The temperature outside was around 24 degrees Fahrenheit (-4 Celsius) that night.

&#x200B;

Upon returning home I noticed that the laptop didn't power on until I plugged it in, but I didn't think too much of it, since I often leave it on sleeping in my backpack with a bunch of tabs and apps open, which usually tends to drain the battery.  Plus I knew that it was cold outside, so I thought that it was reasonable that the battery would drain faster than usual. 

&#x200B;

A bit after powering it up at home last night, I noticed that the battery was at 0% and it wasn't charging, and that's when I realized that the battery probably froze and isn't functioning at all. After looking this issue up I learned that some batteries can get busted if left in the cold for too long, which I didn't know unfortunately.  One of the advices that I found online was letting the laptop to get back into it's normal temperature, so I just left it charging over night, hoping that at some point at night it would come back into working state and would start charging. As you can already predict, that didn't happen. So this morning I unplugged it and left it at home to sit while I'm out taking care of my day. Unfortunately that didn't have any effect (wow what a shocker I know right).

&#x200B;

I was pretty upset when I came home and found it in the same state I left it in, and me having a pretty bad week didn't help the situation. So I started the Support Assist hardware scan, which didn't see any issues. I'm assuming that the Support Assist scans don't look into battery health. So I opened Dell Power manager knowing that it shows the battery health, hoping to see if it says that the battery is missing or something like that. Like you can see in the first screenshot, in the top right corner, it still shows that the battery has 2 out of 4 ""hearts"", which was the case before the incident. So it's either that the application sees the battery and can scan the battery health, but for some reason the battery can't charge, OR the battery is just completely dead, and the Power Manager app just shows the latest reading that it has saved on the battery health, which I believe is the case. 

&#x200B;

In desperation I thought that maybe warming up the battery by a heavy load task would possibly fix the situation, so I put the laptop in the Ultra Performance thermal setting so it works extra hard and loaded up a pretty big Civ 6 save to let it warm up. Unfortunately to me, that's where I had to experience another heartbreak. I noticed that I was getting like 5 frames per second, so I instantly thought that the Nvidia GPU isn't working, which turned out to be the case. 

&#x200B;

The task manager only showed the Intel UHD Graphics card, as you can see in the second screenshot. So I went to try and open the Nvidia Control Panel app and the Nvidia GeForce Experience app to see if there's a way to make the computer see the GPU through either of those apps, which proved to be unsuccessful, as you can see in the third and fourth screenshots. 

&#x200B;

And that's where I'm at right now, no battery and no gpu because of a stupid mistake. I tried restarting it many times, and shutting it off and letting it sit, and trying to use the charger on different ports and nothing helped so far. The funny part is that I also had my airpods in the backpack that night, whos battery also drained. They're charging and are fully functional, so at least there's one ""good"" thing to come out of that.

&#x200B;

Is this the end for me right now, or is there anything else I could do on the software side of things that might fix it? I'm not at all a computer expert, so if there's a way I could use some app to force the laptop to see the battery and gpu that you guys know about, please let me know, that would be lifesaving. 

&#x200B;

If not, then hopefully my L would be in any way useful to you. All the best.

Best value dell refurbished workstation?

I could of course build something from scratch but I think I could get much better value looking at older refurbished workstations. I'm not a big gamer but some of these systems include pro quadro cards anyway which would be more than adequate and better than most new budget graphics cards.

So far I think the Precision 5820 looks like a possible option and I've seen some for fairly cheap prices. It seems to be new enough that it has all the important features like support for M.2, USB 3.1, and ddr4. I really like the flex bay design that allows for four hot swap drives. Is the Linux support good? What is the repairability and noise like?

Question about M4800 charging speed.
"Hi, I got an dell precision m4800 notebook. I have a problem with it, it tooks 3-4 hours to charge from 0-10% to 100%. I tried with two 180W chargers. I measured with power meter, it consumes only 40W while it is powered one. I have a E6440, it consumes more than 80W. 

And another thing I noticed: it has a i7-4810mq cpu, and if it runs on battery, it does not use the turbo frequencies. In the e6440 there is a 4800mq and it could use the turbo. 

I have a new original dell 97Wh battery, and a used little aftermarket 6cells battery. 

My question in, how much time is to charge your m4800 from 0-10% to 100%? 

Thanks in advance.

I went and found [this one](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/332634383654?epid=27018673144&hash=item4d728de526:g:5hAAAOSwbLZa5Brz&amdata=enc%3AAQAHAAAA8G%2FBJ24efEWZVTjQQFwbSkAblStYa7QZIv2cSesVWEUr0KJhrdmtWgc9p1ZJWSWNBvs700l7qTAP5QbN7NOqy3syfg%2BJ4pHhFmuja8F43Eu5UiWmEVfmli12Z5TJTBq6WNZLmQAo3ccOPPU3AvkgGUvv4uQhUxQDpPxCTjGEd61rGTjxyiBsMwtuVdwJ1kmo2fM1ks%2B9IWhB9zqucxsmvbBTM8XqBBczQK7LWdKFzuiz3DU8GCkmgg9RNBl%2FnUtt9opq1u2alpUeA83btfI1vpV%2B3Cv4YuOl0Hu3Re2zSgyyzjzyARoeygdD09COr%2BHTYg%3D%3D%7Ctkp%3ABFBMktCohpJh#mainContent) on ebay. I've already tinkered with electronics before and there are youtube videos on how to remove the keyboard. I'm just wondering if it's as simple as just doing that though, meaning unscrewing and unpluggin the old keyboard and then plugging in and screwing in the new one. Is there anything I have to worry about on the software side other than downloading the correct keyboard language from Microsoft?"

i have been facing a small issue  regarding the power on.

I have a Dell 9430 and as soon as I lock the system with win-l, it looks for me and unlocks.  Does anyone know how to change this behavior?

Sometimes I want to lock it when I am in a busy environment.  Of course I can just turn it off permanentlyâ€¦ but I do like it at other times.

How do I fix the screen color accuracy?
"I'm a digital artist and I was gifted this Dell Inspiron 14 5000. The colors come out differently when I look at my artworks on a different device. I used to draw on an Asus laptop with the same software I use now (Krita) and it always came out perfectly until I made them on this new laptop. I've tried calibrating the colors already but it still doesn't look right. Although possible to get the right calibration and also I can edit the exported image of the artworks, it's time consuming and still not as accurate as I see it on my laptop screen. Is there any easier way of fixing the colors?"

Dell-licensed service in Copenhagen?
"Does anyone know a good Dell service point in Copenhagen? I was recently told by Dell support that they don't have offline locations anymore. My laptop's warranty has expired and I can't find any Dell-licensed repair shops around.

"Dell XPS 8940 with 128gb ram wont boot, boots with 64gb ram"
"Hey guys, 

I have a Dell XPS 8940 with Crucial RAM 64GB Kit (2x32GB) DDR4 3200MHz Desktop Memory CT2K324DFD832A and ive had it running with 64gb ram for about a year now. 

I wanted to add an additional 64gb ram set (2 x 32gb ram) because the xps 8940 can handle 128gb ram so i bought the same 64gb crucial ram set but when i installed it, the desktop wouldnt boot. I get the issue of 2 orange flashes and 4 white flashes which means its a ram issue. But what was weird is that after I installed and uninstalled the additional 64gb ram, my pc wouldnt boot with the 64gb ram originally installed on the computer either, it would only book with one 32gb ram stick. I originally had one 32gb ram stick in each while ram slot and it worked before i tried all this but it didnt work after. I could get the pc to boot with just one of ANY of the four 32gb ram sticks but not 2 or 4 of them. So it wasnt like the ram was defective.

I read online that i have to reset the bios by removing the motherboard battery which i did but that didnt fix the problem. What fixed the problem of the computer not booting with 64gb ram (even though it originally did) and only with 32gb ram was placing 1 ram stick in a white colored ram slot and 1 ram stick in the black colored ram slot even though they originally were into white colored ram slots. 

I was just glad that i got my original 64gb ram to work. So i thought maybe the additional 64gb ram was defective so i got a replacement set but i have the same issue with the replacement ram set and cant get 128gb to work. They are all 4 the same brand. The bios has been updated to the latest version and also every windows and dell update has been installed

Any recommendations? 

Thank you"

Precision 7920 Rack - Updates
"Hi Reddit!  


**So let me start off by saying I am completely aware that the Dell Precision 7920 Rack model is not a PowerEdge Server**. It's capable of being used as a server but is not designed for that function. It's a workstation.

However, it does contain iDRAC 9 Enterprise (at least mine does) and a number of other server-grade awesomeness. When it comes to major BIOS updates however, it is interestingly bundled alongside the Dell PE R740-range of products.

Because it's not a PowerEdge though, finding an update mechanism similar to what the PE line gets is...difficult. *There's no Platform Specific Bootable ISO like all of the PE models have, and because it's not a PE, it simply does not appear as an option in Dell's preferred ""Dell EMC Repository Manager"".*

Short of downloading each and every single piece of firmware updates available (over 140 at the moment), is there /ANY/ scalable, even iDRAC compatible ISO based update mechanism that will work independently of the installed operating systems and allow me to update any firmware that is detected in system and provide driver updates to Lifecycle Controller for new OS deployments and the like?

Please help me reddit, you're my only hope...  
(seeing as Dell support doesn't seem to know what to do either)

Thanks!"

Do you have this laptop? Have you had any of these issues? Bought the laptop from a refurbishment company in ""very good"" condition with 1 year of warranty with possibility to extend to 3 years. 

Haven't received it yet, but after seeing all those issues people had, at some point I was thinking to cancel the order/ return the item. 

Also, the laptop comes with a French keyboard layout. Is it a pain to change the keyboard?

Does G15 5520 have a PWM screen?

I read good things about its performance on reviews and I am OK with only one M2 slot. However, the link doesn't say if it has the 120Hz screen or the 165Hz one. I have started to worry because everyone is praising the 165Hz one and strongly advising against the 120Hz option. 

I'll be using this for game design classes and my wife will use it as her gaming laptop other times. Basically we'll sit in front of its screen for many long hours. I think we can live with lower sRGB coverage and slow response times but I read on several Reddit and Youtube comments that it had PWM brightness control and it got me worried as it can physically cause problems for the eyes. 

There are some review links to closer models like G15 5510 and G15 5515 but not on G15 5520. 5515 has PWM flickering and 5510 doesn't have it.

May I get a confirmation and advise from those who have seen/used 5520? How bad is the screen? Does it actually use PWM control for brightness, assuming it comes with the 120Hz panel?

My BIOS Update won't work
"Hello,

I have tried updating my BIOS for my Dell desktop, so I went to their website to get the update. I am currently running on version 1.1.1 (according to System Information) and I am pretty sure I have traced some problems I am having down to my outdated drivers. 

I installed the G5\_5000\_1.11.0.exe file from the Dell website, which it said is needed for my system. After running the executable, it restarted my system a couple times and allowed me to log back in. The problem is it never updated my BIOS. It never went into a BIOS menu or the Dell splash screen thing. It just restarted twice and nothing changed.

Did I miss a step? If anyone has had this problem, or knows what I did wrong, please let me know. Thank you."

XPS 13 7390 annoyances after updating BIOS and various drivers
"A few times a day, my computer will just stop playing certain playback media. This includes apps like Spotify and websites like Youtube. For the latter, videos and video thumbnails will not load. Strangely, Instagram videos and audio still seem to work. I can fix the issue momentarily if I restart my device, but then a couple hours later it will happen again. Sometimes it will resolve itself but it takes too long, and then it goes and happens again. I think this is the same problem as in this [unsolved thread.](https://www.dell.com/community/XPS/XPS-13-9370-having-to-restart-as-video-won-t-play/td-p/7276513)   


Please let me know if you need any more information that could help identify the problem. I'm not very good with computers so I apologize if this is an inadequate amount to begin with."
XPS 13 7390 annoyances after updating BIOS and various drivers
Struggling between Dell XPS 15 (9520) and Dell Inspiron 16+ (7620)
"Where I am, the XPS 15 (12700H, 3050-ti) is on a $370 discount ($1650) and the Inspiron (12700H, 3060) on a $260 discount ($1380). 

Pros of Inspiron: $270 cheaper, better gpu (3060 60W vs 3050-TI 40W), better ports (USB and HDMI)

Pros of XPS: Form factor (which is important to me, I travel and move around a lot) - lighter, smaller, thinner, thinner bezels. Also has option for FHD (better for games and battery life), I don't need 3k

I also have a $150 gift card, so on top of the discount both are pretty good deals. I'm really split between them. 

 Any and all help is much appreciated."
PC wonâ€™t boot (Dell Inspiron 3847)
"I took out the cpu fan and wiped off the dust, and accidentally hit the black button next to the green light on the power supply. Google said to take out the CMOS battery and wait two minutes and put it back, but now the power button is flashing orange in intervals of five. How do I fix this?"
Does the XPS 13 Plus collect smudges like the regular XPS 13?
"I have a Dell XPS 13 and I hate it simply because it gets smudged easily. After using it for a couple of hours, the whole keyboard is covered in fingerprints. The palm rest too. I've resulted to using an external keyboard and mouse to avoid cleaning the laptop repeatedly, and so moving the laptop around is something I avoid. Thing is, I never had this issue with my last HP or with my current ThinkPad I got from my employer, and this has put me off Dell.

However, I saw the XPS 13 Plus and it is a thing of beauty. I'm thinking of getting it, but I want to know if it's the same as the XPS 13 when it comes to smudges."
xps 15 9510 overheating instead of turning off
"Hello, on my xps 15 9510 running W11 I have this weird issue.

When I am done with my work, I turn off my laptop, clicking on the windows icon, then the IO symbol on the bottom right of the menu, then turn off.

Every single laptop in the world would behave by turning the system off, while my XPS 15 sometimes turns off properly, some other times hangs in some kind of limbo, where the system is shut down, the screen is turned off, but the machine just goes in an ethernal overheating with vents at max speed.

In order to shut it down completely I have to press on the physical power button for some seconds, that usually happens around 30 minutes of overheating, which creates some problems when turning the laptop on again (windows recovery messages due to turn off in a forced way).

Is there a way to prevent this from happening?

All my options are set to hybernate when closing the lid or pressing the power button, however this is about the normal way to turn off my laptop from windows.

Windows update is up to date, Dell update is up to date."

Upgrading my Dell Inspiron R17 N7110 laptop (motherboard swap?)
"I have recently received a Dell Inspiron N7110 with an intel 5i cpu, 8gb ram, and an intel family graphics card. The computer ran very well, but soon I realized that it cannot run many games because it needs a stronger graphics card (This includes many 3D games or even Minecraft). I did some research and know that the gpu is soldered on.

Iâ€™ve heard of swapping motherboards to a similar motherboard holding a nvidia gt525m (instead of intel). Supposedly Dell shipped these PCâ€™s with one of these two motherboards and I was wondering if it would be possible for me to swap the boards.

If so, does anyone have any advice? (Maybe even about an external gpu)"

Just bought a new X14- question about the ProSupport
"Just bought an aliewnare x14 gaming laptop off of dell's website.
On their options, it says their prosupport - 1 year is included - there isn't any option to de-select it or take it off.
However, after paying the bill and looking at the itemized details there's a item charge ""ProSupport:7x24 Technical Support, 1 Year"" for $251.75.
Is this their way of forcing the support on us? I mean they masked it as being free of charge, when they really bundled it just in. Any way to get this removed?"
Dell XPS 9510 Laptop + 2 external 4K Monitors (but one is 30hz while the other is 60hz)
"I have 2 laptops, one for work and one for play. The work laptop is a Dell XPS 9510 (2022 with nvidia 3050ti) and the play laptop is a Razer Blade 14 (2021 with nvidia 3070). 

The two external monitors I have are both Dell U2723QE 4K. Both computers are running the latest windows 11 update, and both graphics cards have been updated.

I'm using a USB-C (DisplayPort) to connect from the laptops to one monitor (and the 3rd monitor is daisy-chained with a standard displayport cable).

On the work laptop (dell), it gives me 60hz on one of the 4K displays, and 30hz on the other 4K display.
On the play laptop (razer), it gives me 60hz on both displays.

Does anyone know how I can configure the Dell to give me 60hz on both displays? It's driving me crazy."
Dell Inspiron Touchpad Gesture Windows 10

Issues with i7 12700T optiplex 5000/7000 series
"Hello all, I am unable to image our new 5000/7000 optiplex machines, as they are not detecting the USB (always) we use sccm to create and image the machines and I have downloaded the latest driver pack for windows pe from Dell.  I worked with Dell support and used our reps to get engineer level support.  However after 2 weeks they came back and said the issue is with our windows pe image, when the usb is not detected in bios, and it can kill the mouse/keyboard as well.  So when we boot up with a keyboard and a usb stick in the machine it just goes to the Keyboard not detected bios error and reboots, meanwhile no lights or response from keyboard, our usb sticks have a light that comes one to show they are plugged in and that comes on but no change.  If through some random boot miracle, I can get into the f12 menu to select something, the usb will not be there.  These sticks work on the following machines:  
Dell:

7400,7410,5050,5060,7420,7430, 7530, 7480 aio

Windows:

Surface pro 3,4,5,8,9 surface go 3, surface laptop 3

Mac:

M1,M2, intel all 2018+

Lenovo

T490, m80q,t460,t470,t480  


We create the boot media with Rufus, and even if there is nothing on it or one created with Windows Boot media creator no change.  I have tried other sticks but those are older and not UEFI compatible, so they are not detected at all.  Was unable to update bios via a stick had to use network, default bios options, usb ports are enabled.  If there is no usb plugged in everything works, and there is a greater chance of usb detection once we finish setting up the machine with the Dell image it comes with, but still can cause a problem on the reboots when imaging.  So anyone run into this, is there a compatibility issue?  I tried to get a response from the engineer on their processes so I can mirror them, but still waiting, maybe next week!"

Split the charger or keep it in one piece

S2721DGF with a black vignette when system starts?
" 

Hello, community!

I recently got a new S2721DGF from a Dell RMA (yea, this is the FOURTH unity I got for this model... I'm being extreme unlucky with Dell. I've even asked here for some help regarding the last unity) and I noticed that whenever the monitor turns off, manually pressing the button or automatically when there's no signal, and turns back on after few minutes, the left border of the monitor gets a black semi-transparent vignette that keeps there for few seconds (sometimes more, sometimes less) and then it vanishes, getting to the normal lighting again, as you can see in the two videos I uploaded below (sorry for the vertical recording).

[https://youtube.com/shorts/g20il1Z4DeU?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/g20il1Z4DeU?feature=share) (between 49s and 52s)

[https://youtube.com/shorts/iX3etIFk7X4?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/iX3etIFk7X4?feature=share) (right after I turn it on)

I'm wondering if I got, AGAIN, another faulty unity from Dell and, to be honest, I would not be surprised if that's case... but if it's, I will try argue with them to either get my money back or having them sending me a different model.

What do you guys think about this case? I've dig through the internet a little bit and could not find anything similar to what I'm facing so I'm posting here to see if someone can guide me on what to do.

Thanks in advance!

Deciding on if to return my refurbished Latitude 7280

Billing Question
"Odd experience with Dell. Any ideas on what happened?

I ordered a computer on Dell.com back in April. Checked out using PayPal. A few days after ordering I check status and the shipping date changed from a few days to MONTHS later in October. Disappointing. So I call in. 

I get transferred about 7 times and finally someone tells me the device is back ordered and Iâ€™ll have to wait. So I suck it up and wait. They had nothing comparable available now. 

Then in July they tell me congrats your computer is shipping early! 

Flash forward to today. I get a weird email that my dell invoice is outstanding. I need to wire money ACH to some account in Pennsylvania. Sounds really fishy but it has lots of my personal info. 

I hop on customer service chat to see if itâ€™s legit and they canâ€™t help. So they give me a number to call. Call in and get transferred 7 times (not exaggerating). Finally a guy basically says heâ€™s gotta email some other department to find out.

At this point Iâ€™m livid. I spent months waiting on an order that told me it would ship in a couple of days. Spent so much time investigating that and trying to find a replacement solution. Then now this weird billing thing. I just want to return it and never deal with Dell again. 

Is this normal to send an invoice to a regular consumer like this? Why didnâ€™t they just charge my PayPal directly? The email address that sent it is some GNT_Accounts thing but ends in @dell.com. I almost deleted it because I thought it was a spam/phishing."

Strange behavior on Alienware Area 51m
"I need help with my Alienware Area 51m

He has strange behavior.

When I'm playing games the FPS drops down and causes a bottleneck on the machine.

However, the issue is fixed when I change the power plan setting by setting the value 99% in the processor power management for the outlet.

Once I set the value to 99% the bottleneck stops and the FPS doesn't drop anymore!

I downloaded the Afterburner program and noticed that if the processor Power Management plan is at 100% the GPU hits 100% often is the MHZ and wattage drops down often too.

What could it be ?

Dell P2720DC blurry on lower resolutions
"Hello folks,

I've got a fairly simple problem - I'm using Dell P2720DC as my home office monitor. It's super crisp at 2560 x 1440. I've got it connected directly to my HP Elite Dragonfly laptop.

Lately I've found that I liked everything a bit larger so I changed to 1920 x 1080. And there's the problem - everything went blurry / fuzzy. I've tried changing refresh rate with no success, still blurry. Tried other lower resolutions, same thing.

At the moment my solution is to put on 2560 x 1440 and just scale display up to 125%, but that also gives a blurry picture.

Any help is appreciated, cheers."

I mostly live in the Mac world, so this is a newb question. I noticed my XPS17 gets updates through Windows Update, but also can get updates through Dell Support Assist. The problem is they seem to be updating each other. Dell Support assist will update driver X, then Windows Update will update Driver X, and around we go.

Is it best to have driver updates through Dell Support Assist or Windows?

Thank you!"
Dock WD22TB4 and Latitude 7320 Detachable
"Hi Reddit,

Hoping someone can help me troubleshoot the following.  Not sure if this is a limitation of the tablet, CPU, TB4 ports, or my understanding....

With the subject setup, I can get 2, 4k60hz (DP) but my 3rd 4k runs at 30hz through a [usbc to hdmi adapter](https://www.primecables.ca/p-365382-cab-utc-uh01-usb-c-to-hdmi-adapter-supports-hdmi-resolution-max-to-3840x216060hz-primecables?from_pla=google&sku=376983&gclid=Cj0KCQiAg_KbBhDLARIsANx7wAwCbYkRw0JgU-f9D1Y40uveSE2SMmYaeM1VGaSIkrNaAb8RFbf5eKcaAndFEALw_wcB#sku376983). When using the adapter I have been running in either of the TB4 port closes to the cable that attaches to my laptop. Can't remember if I've tried using the HDMI or MFDP type-c port.

The tablet that I have ([Dell Latitude 7320 Detachable](https://www.dell.com/en-ca/shop/laptops-ultrabooks/latitude-7320-detachable/spd/latitude-13-7320-detachable-laptop)) has two TB4 ports. With one TB4 running the WD22TB4 and the 3 monitors I bought an additional USBC to HDMI adapter hoping I could do at least 3, 4k60hz (2 through WD, 1 through usbc to HDMI directly on the 2nd TB4 on the tablet) with the 4th at maybe 30hz. But for whatever reason when I connect all 4 monitors the best I can do currently is 2 4k60, and 2 1440,60hz and I'm not sure why. I should note that I have to change the usb adapter from the TB4 ports closest to the WD22TB4 cable into the MFDP USBC port for the 2nd adapter to even be recognized. I think I can use either the MFDP or the HDMI port for this config. Also I find it odd that the 2, 4ks are coming from a DP from the WD22TB4 and the laptop connected usbc to HDMI adapter.

On a side note I purchased a couple of [displayport to HDMI adapters](https://www.primecables.ca/p-396972-cab-pc-08343-displayport14-to-hdmi8k-adapter-primecables) but was unable to get displays to work with the WD22TB4 at 4k60. I can use the adapters on my main desktop computer (nvidia quadro P1000) but the WD22TB4 doesn't like it :(  


I'm not sure if instead of using the USBC to HDMI adapters a USBC to display port would work better?  Ideally I'd like to use HDMI as I already bought the cables.  If I had to use display port I would then have to buy an additional 2 longer HDMIs to connect my desktop back.  (Have a sit stand desk)"
Alienware FPS drops when connecting two chargers
"Hello

I have an Alienware Area 51m R1 and when I'm playing with both chargers connected the FPS drops to low.

Usually drops from 200 fps to 30 fps

When I leave only one charger connected the FPS is good around 180 fps to 200 fps.

l check in the BIOS and when the two chargers are connected it shows 420w.

One charger is 180w and the other is 240w.

The games works fine if only one charger is plugged in.

What is happening, is it a configuration?

How can I solve ?"

Beware buying the AW3423DW
"Hello,

I may be a sample size of 1, but I just want to warn others of the possibility before blasting 1.2k.

I purchased the AW3423DW QD-OLED monitor around end of august. However, upon obtaining it, there was delivery damage - scratches on the screen, and some minor damage on the frame. I purchased the monitor for full price from the Dell website.

Immediately, I contacted Dell, and received a replacement I must admit, I admire that they replied at a decent speed. The replacement was even worse - more scratches on the screen that were more explicit...

Again, I contacted Dell, and after returning the 34 pound package, **they lied about me not returning the monitor - just in time for me to no longer have my 30 day return window despite me showing the FEDEX return tracking number saying otherwise**. After cleaning that mess up with a fusion ticket and about 10 support calls, they sent me another replacement. However, this time, the package came in a small box that had no screen protector....

That's when Dell told me this exact quote: **Dell sell refurbish as new monitors are dell certified for used however as any refurbish replacement there are some small cosmetic details that are allow.**

In other words, it seemed like Dell sent me a damaged, refurbished monitor under the tag of ""new monitor""...

I sent yet another 34 ibs package back to them. In return, they asked for another sticky note. I provided, and again, another shipment arrived to my house last week...

This is now the 4th replacement and to the surprise of absolutely no one, it was damaged. 

TL;DR: After 4 replacements due to damage upon delivery, Dell gave me the same reply to send me another replacement after another sticky note and another 34 pound return with no compensation despite having no monitor for ~3 months...if that risk is worth it to you, get the monitor -- it's beautiful, when you ignore these blemishes.."
Would it be possible to put new memory in my dell prebuilt?
This isnt the exact one but its pretty similar:[Dell prebuilt](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/hp-envy-desktop-intel-core-i5-12gb-memory-1tb-ssd-nightfall-black/6477683.p?skuId=6477683)
Can a 3060 Micro use a 65W processor?
"I built a PLEX server from a 5060 Micro with an 8500T.  I am peaking at 95-100% in some transcodes, so an 8700 would definitely buy some margin for those cases.  The 8700T 2.4GHz sell for a small fortune, probably because they were mostly OEM CPUs and not many made.  The 8700 65W version can be found relatively easily.

The CPU heatsink in the Micro is aluminum, and frankly not quite a beast, but the 8500T never gets above 70C under big loads, but the fan never ramps up from an inaudible level.  The PSU brick I got with it is 130W, so no problem there.  My kids' laptop idles at 90C, so i'm sure the CPu would be fine in the rare transcodes it needs to work hard.

I know the 7060 can use a 65W CPU, so I feel the 5060 probably could too, but before I spend the dough I'd like to hear from someone that knows a little more."
"Dell Inspiron 5558 laptop, can not update the graphics driver to save my life. will factory reset give me the updated video driver?"
"Intel support assistant can not update the driver (Intel HD Graphics 5500) because it's locked to Dell. I've downloaded and installed what the Dell website recommended as the updated video driver. Three times I've done this, restarted, and nothing seems to have changed. My graphics driver is still 3 years out of date according to systemsrequirementslab.

I'm running out of options to try and get the graphics driver updated. If I factory reset the laptop, will that force the most updated video driver on the laptop or will I still be stuck in the same position?

Dell r210ii power supply failure
"Hi everyone. I believe the PSU (N250E-S0) on my r210ii died overnight. I woke up to a notification from my uptime monitoring service saying that my interface was down. I checked verizons outage map and no outages in my area. I connected a monitor to my r210 (running pfSense) and had no picutre. I noticed it was off so i hit the power button and nada. Checked the cable to the UPS and all good there (as well as the plug itself with another device). Opened the lid to the server and the green LED light on the motherboard was not lit. I had another PSU laying around but it was not a server PSU, rather, just a 550w corsair from my bench machine. Plugged it in, green status light lit up but the server won't turn on (even if i press the plunger on the mobo that the lid pushes down on) and i know that PSU is known good. My question is will these servers run on desktop PSUs or the specific PSU for the server only? I haven't lost a non-hot swap PSU before because my other servers have dual PSUs. I'm a little nervous that the board might be fried but wanted to gain the perspective of the community before freaking out. Thanks!"
What is wrong with my Latitude 7390 2-in-1
"I bought a 7390 2-in-1 on the cheap today, it came with Windows license but no OS installed, so I installed Windows 11, but the problems started before I had even managed to install Windows.

On boot I am greeted by the message â€œ(A7) Me FW Downgrade - Request MeSpiLock Failedâ€

No biggie, I thought, Iâ€™ll install all the drivers, flash the latest BIOS and everything will be fine. Well, it isnâ€™t. All the drivers installed fine, except for Wifi, the installation is interrupted by the message â€œThis installation is forbidden by system policy. Contact your system administrator.â€

Funnily enough Bluetooth works just fine, whatâ€™s even more puzzling that sometimes Wifi does appear and I can even connect to network, but as quickly as that comes it disappears just as quickly.

When I look at the BIOS it says that no Wifi device is installed.

Iâ€™ve tried upgrading BIOS, downgrading BIOS, restoring BIOS, but it always ends in the same way, during flashing the error message â€œME Firmware Update Failed: Image Loadingâ€, followed by â€œME update failedâ€

The BIOS update utility does not display the previous version of Intel Management Engine (VPro LP) Update and Integrated Sensor Hub, those fields are just blank.

Also ME Current Working State is listed as Recovery (in HWinfo)

I also took off the baseplate to inspect the Wifi module, it seems to be the correct one: 8265NGW

&#x200B;

Has anyone got any ideas how this can be solved? Any help would be much appreciated because right now Iâ€™m totally stumped

&#x200B;

EDIT: In case anyone ever stumbles upon this post with the same problem: I did end up returning the laptop to the shop and exchanged it for another 7390 2-in-1 of the exact same specifications and this one runs as it should. So it's probably corrupted firmware which I have no idea if it can be fixed."

"Dell Inspiron 15 7537 Lock out

I inherited this laptop and it is showing a password unlock key screen with an unlock key number. 

I tried doing the bios decoders online to no avail. I also am in contact with Dell support, but the original live chat was unproductive. The support person told me that there was some kind of malfunction on the motherboard, which just seems to be a lie in my best estimation.

Does anybody have any ideas on how I could unlock this computer? 

I'm not really concerned about seeing whatever data is on it. A full reset would be perfectly acceptable.

What graphics card in Dell Inspiron 3511?
"Hi,

I'm trying to compare two laptops, but this one hasn't been set up so there's only the box to go by.

The graphics card, on the box, just says ""intel iris"". Online I can't find any straight intel irises, just ones with added numbers. Does anyone know what exact card these laptops use? 

I only have the box to go by, numbers that might be relevant:
Model #3511-0407

The processor is Intel I7-1165G7

Maybe if anyone has the same type they'd know what graphics card it has?

"Compatible 5.25"" multiple HDD caddy?"
"Context: Sydney, Australia. Parts must be available from Dell or from someone who will send to Australia.

Purchased a Dell Optiplex 9020 that I have been using as a desktop.  Original Specs: Core i7-4790 3.60Ghz, upgraded to 32Gb Ram, upgraded to 2x 2Tb SSD.

The unit currently has a DVD-RW however I have never used this and dont need it anymore.  Was thinking I could find a Dell compatible caddy, I may be able to add a 'dual HDD caddy' allowing me to replace the DVD-RW with dual HDDs.  There is also another empty 5.25"" drive bay with nothing it in below as well.

It would be nice to turn this into a bit of a small server, find something that can fit into the 2 x 5.25"" bays and allow me to add some extra HDDs.

Maybe something like this? [https://www.amazon.com/SmartLifeTime-Internal-Mounting-Converter-Material/dp/B01M0AUIDU](https://www.amazon.com/SmartLifeTime-Internal-Mounting-Converter-Material/dp/B01M0AUIDU)

Of course I would need a SATA extension card too, and possibly a larger power supply.

Fixing Dual-Cable Dock USB Issues (WD19DC)
"I recently got a new Precision 7560 mobile workstation and tried to connect it to my WD19DC only to notice that USB devices plugged into the dock are not working at all. Plugging into the ports of the notebook directly worked fine but only the connection via the dock seemed to fail. The WD19DC has a dual USB-C cable and is the recommended dock for the 7560 according to the official compatibility guide (even though the 7560 has dual TB4). I tried reconnecting the dock, restarting both devices, plugging in the USB devices multiple times into the dock but nothing worked.
However, I remembered from previous struggle with other Dell notebooks, that for some reason not both cables are equally used for the USB connection. So I tried to plug in only one of the cables and even though the graphics seemed unable to handle it (seeing only black bg with mouse pointer), my USB keyboard instantly connected. So I tried rearranging and rotating the USB-C cables (they're clipped together with magnets) and finally it worked!

I don't know why, but I think it has something to do with the order in which the dock is registering the two USB-C connections with the notebook's controller. You can see that when plugging in both cables at the same time, the LEDs of the plugs turn on one after another with a delay of at least half a second. Maybe only one of the cables is able to carry the USB signal and if not plugged into the correct port in the right order both notebook and dock disable forwarding USB connections. I had some unpleasant experience with Dell Docks in the past (e.g. knocking out my ethernet switch by flooding it with packages in certain situations, which is an Ethernet protocol violation) so I'm not very surprised."

Upgrade Advice
"Hi all, My laptop is an Inspiron 15-3567 with 8GB ram, 1TB HDD, and an i3-7130.

 I am looking to upgrade the ram and storage. The dell website states that the ram can be expanded to 16gbs and storage up to 256gb with a SATA SSD and 1tb with a HDD. 

For the Ram I plan on purchasing a 8gb stick at 2400mhz  from crucial (to give 16gbs total), although crucial states that I can expand up to 32gbs. 

 However for the SSD, I would like to know if I have to stick to the 256gbs as recommended by dell, or if I can run the 1tb ssd? 

Crucial states that I can run the 1tb SSD, however amazon's compatibility finder disagrees.

Any help would be greatly appreciated."

AW2521H still not supported by Dell Display Manager 2 years later
"When I purchased **AW2521H** (1080p 360 Hz), I assumed support for **Dell Display Manager** was lacking due to the monitor being new. I assumed it would come for it at some point, but 2 years later, it **STILL** hasn't.

What's going on? Why are such lower end models being supported but mine isn't? I feel pretty bad having paid so much more than so many others of your monitor customers, yet I'm getting forgotten. When is support coming? Is it being worked on? If not, then why? This is a high end model, not some cheap 60Hz 1080p TN screen.

For reference, here's the list of supported monitors - [https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-uk/000060112/what-is-dell-display-manager](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-uk/000060112/what-is-dell-display-manager)

Don't buy products directly from the Dell website
"Recently bought a Dell XPS 9315 from the Dell website. It was on a Â£150 off offer. That's all good but the issue is with delivery.

Dell uses **Syncreon** for its deliveries. And Syncreon uses DHL to fulfill the deliveries for them. It's nigh-impossible to track deliveries on the Syncreon website. BTW if you want to track them on DHL just use 39999+your order number to follow up.

Neither Syncreon nor DHL was able to deliver it to my house. Moreover, they weren't able to deliver it to a collection point listed by DHL on its own website. As shown in the image DHL claims that it is not DHLs responsibility to maintain an updated list of service points for themselves.

After delaying for about six days, while I was in constant contact with Dell, Syncreon, and DHL I had to end up traveling to the city with the DHL depot to pick it up myself. Meanwhile, all the promises made by Syncreon regarding priority delivery the next day failed four times.

Dell offered me compensation of Â£80 for my troubles...

Dell Latitude 5520 - NVME Temperature and Battery Problem
"I have recently been given a new Dell Latitude 5520 company laptop, that was bought from Dell Outlet (due to availability issues).

I have noticed that the SSD runs really hot all the time, idling at 80 degC. Could someone else with a similar laptop confirm that this is normal? I have other laptops and the NVME drives never idle at such high temperatures.

I am wondering, as the battery drain is quite substantial. The laptop lasts 4-5 hours max. on battery, whereas my old latitude 5590 would last 8-9 hours easily. My new laptop has no dedicated graphics card, just built-in GPU in the CPU.

I am wondering if a failing NVME can cause overheating and battery drain. I am contemplating replacing this NVME with a different one, but if those temperatures are normal then maybe the problem lies elsewhere.

PS. The drive is really getting hot, as I can feel the heat when touching the bottom of the laptop next to where the drive is installed, so it is not just a problem with the temperature sensor."
Dell aw2721d OS wide mouse 1/240th frame cursor stutter
"If anyone didn't know this and needed a solution, after testing every possible configuration outside of changing motherboard,cpu and ram, including all bios settings and drivers/programs/os installs, dp 1.4 etc multiple everything

Dell aw2721d OS wide mouse 1/240th frame cursor stutter when doing circles with the mouse every 300-900 milliseconds missing 1 frame on cursor move only, this happens on any monitor even when on log in screen. So it affects the input of a device at the os level.

This happens because when setting aw2721d to 240hz it causes system wide stutter for the input device of a mouse(it passes all 240hz frameskipping tests on blurbusters so its not frameskipping), setting it to 200hz and it fixes everything for all monitors.

Whether they knew this issue or not mines an earlier version.

I dont mind 200hz and i have a perfect panel, so technically you can rma or update firmware?Should I?

Question with Phantom Files/ Full SDD

For information: I have 224 GB of Space and only 23 GB available. But when I used WinDirStat its only showing im using 159GB. So I should have 64GB available (which make sense), but since I only have 23 GB it mean that I have around 40GB used by phantom files (or whatever) that I just cant find and not even WindDirStat.

plus, I noticed with WInDirStat that I have two windows folder (windows and windows.old) between those two I have 50 GB of space. Is there a reason to have both? any way to maximize this space?

so, i opened the bezel and by frustrated move I gently pushed the don't touch part in the bottom of the screen (Ya telling myself its damaged already)  but when i touched certain point the screen shows clear image again!! and i noticed it's also work if I gently bend the screen (from main laptop lip) and yes it runs fine after that as im using the laptop to write my issue now 

i do one of the two methods if the screen somehow went back to the issue and till now it ok

so please what do you think? should i look for new screen or it can be fixed?  maybe some wire under that plastic cover need to be checked because when i pushed it i felt like there is a solder node

if i want to replace the screen any recommendation where to find excellent 4k screen any recommended brand etc ?"
Dell 7710 Wireless Stop Working Under Load
"I'm using a Dell 7710 running Arch Linux. It has the wireless card that came with it new some 5 years ago. I'm not sure how long this has been happening because it's an intermittent issue, but it seems that the wireless stops working after dealing with relatively heavy load.

For instance, watching a Youtube video is fine, but if I'm looking for a particular part of a video and scrub through, it will stop working for several seconds at a time. (I note that watching a single video will fill the buffer, then not have to download until the video gets closer to the end of the buffer, but if scrolling, buffering is much heavier.)

Is this a known problem with this model of Dell Precision? I just had the idea to `journalctl --follow` to see if anything strange shows up there when the problem happens, but the problem isn't terribly reproducible. Any ideas would be appreciated!"

Upgrade XPS 15 battery before purchase
"Hello! I am looking to get the Dell XPS 15 in its cheapest configuration, so that would be i5-12500H with integrated Intel Iris Xe graphics chip, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, 15.6"" 1920x1200p 60 Hz.
Unfortunately, this laptop comes with a 56Wh battery while more expensive configurations are available with an 86Wh battery.
Simply getting a different configuration to get the larger battery is not an option, this configuration is â‚¬1.258,99 whereas any other configuration that comes with the larger battery costs at least â‚¬2.238,98, which is outside of my budget, plus a way worse bang for my buck.
I contacted support to see if I could get the configuration above with an 86Wh battery, but they said this is not possible. All they can do is sell me a larger battery after I've bought the laptop, which I imagine would be rather expensive, plus then I'd be stuck with the smaller bgattery. Does anyone have any tips on what I could do?

"Inspiron 16 Plus 7620: Fan Speed under ""normal"" office use..."
"Hello dear forum community,

above mentioned laptop DELL Inspiron 16 Plus with i7 12700H / 32GB RAM is in my possession since yesterday. I am very happy with everything, except the fans :(

My apartment is currently not even particularly warm, only 22 Â°... and despite that, the fans turn up quite a bit when I'm just doing normal office work. That is very annoying. However, the CoreTemp CPU temperatures are only at a smooth 35-45Â°. ...completely incomprehensible for me, but Fans keep running and running.

&#x200B;

I know it was mentioned in quite some reviews... but is there anything I can do?

In the BIOS I find NO settings for the fans! SpeedFan / Fan Control / MSI Afterburner: All installed, but none of these SW seems to recognize or control the fans, there are no ""Fan RPM settings"" available - those applications just recognize my thermal sensors, nothing else - do I need specific config files? 

Running Handbrake transcoding or Prime95 gives the impression that the laptop is about to take off.... Incredibly annoying.

Thanks in advance!"
Do I have Sim card support?
"So my company sent me a Dell latitude 5521. At the back at the battery, there is a SIM card slot. However, after inserting a SIM card there windows acts like nothing changed. There is no network adapter either, nor can I see anything related to SIM in the bios. So I'm stating to think that there is no support, but I can't get over the fact that there is slot. Can there be a slot and no hardware to actually read the card? How can I check it without having to contact my company?"

Need help Undervolting dell g15 5520
"I have seen earlier steps to unlock cfg lock in bios for 5510 but the offset values are different for bios of 5520 and the ifrextract runs in an infinite loop and text file keeps increasing with error, thus unable to locate the offset address for cfg and overclocking lock."
Latitude 5401 overheating issues
"So I pieced together a latitude 5401 from 2 parts machines. What I ended up with is specced as follows: 

i5-9400h

16gb ram 
1tb nvme drive 
1080p non touch panel
Win11 pro


My problem is as follows: 

Every time I try to game using a tb3 dock (set up with a psu, ethernet, 2 displays, USB keyboard/mouse, and USB audio interface for mic and headphones), after a bit, the type c dock's USB ports stop working. The displays, Ethernet, and power still work. 

I've also tried a separate type c hub that I use for Samsung Dex that has my USB audio, USB keyboard, Ethernet, and HDMI, and it does the same thing. 

If I plug in all my accessories directly into the laptop however, it seems to work just fine. I've repasted the CPU/GPU and cleaned the fan. What else could I do to help my scenario? I really want to use this as my gaming machine, eventually with a tb3 egpu."

"Slow charger warning with 100W charger, but not with a 90W charger"
"I'm trying to find a nice GaN charger due to size. The original charger that came with my Dell Latitude 5521 is 130W (USB-C). I have a Dell Monitor that also charges my laptop via USB-C (90W).

I now tried the Anker 735 (65W charger) and Windows reports ""slow charger"" right away. Looking at the charging statistic, I see that the laptop really is charging slower:

[65W Anker 735 vs Dell factory charger](https://preview.redd.it/4zbof0dlnh2a1.png?width=678&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=44356dffe20cfbc2c752e7ca4b2d257facdcca55)

I thought the Anker 737 (120W charger, 100W max per port) would be ""good enough"", but Windows still reports ""slow charger"". Windows **does not** report ""slow charger"" for the Dell Monitor 90W charger, even though the Anker 737 is supposed to be more powerful.

I assume this is the chipset on the Anker chargers - they're doing/reporting something to Windows/the laptop that it doesn't like. I have to try some other small GaN chargers and just hope for another chipset (trying UGREEN next).

I know I can disable the slow charger warning in Windows, what I am actually wondering is: **How does Windows know?** Can I check somehow what Windows is expecting, e.g. ""at least 12V at 10A"" or whatever? How does Windows figure out this is a slow charger? Do the Dell chargers (inside the Monitor, or also a Dell docking station I have) report some Dell magic?

EDIT: 

The Anker 737 actually works great (no slow charger warning) - I didn't use the correct USB-C cable or a cable that is rated for many watts."

Dell Inspiron 5425 Wifi problems
"I recently got a new Dell Inspiron 14 laptop with R5 5625U, and it has the unfamous Mediatek MT7921 Wifi card which I believe is known for having a lot of problems, as I read here on Reddit. For example, I am a university student, and on my old HP Pavillion laptop from 2016 which has an Intel Wifi card, I am getting the max download speed of \~40 Mbps, and here on my new Dell I am lucky to get 12-20 Mbps. It's even worse if I have my bluetooth headphones connected, then I get around 5-8 Mbps, but the weird thing is that it's not always like that, I already tried updating the drivers, the BIOS and all the drivers are fully up to date. So my question is what should I do, should I buy a Intel AX210 card and swap it out ? I heard that's the best solution."
"What is wrong with my Dell's 2-in-1 Laptop keyboard? Randomly stops responding, only have methods to temporary fix it. Have tried nearly everything, no luck. Please help investigate it together and hopefully we can get it resolved!"
"Hi experts, I would like to know if anyone knows how to solve this problem with my keyboard. I have a Dell 9310 2-in-1 laptop, and have had it for about a year and a half. The problem started to happen about half a year ago and I cannot find a permanent solution to fix it. 

Basically, the keyboard would randomly stops responding completely, sometimes you can have no problem for a few days straight, but sometimes it can reappear as soon as in a few mins. Because my laptop is a 2-in-1 so it can be flipped over, the keyboard would come back to life after I flipped my screen over and flipped back. And no, it's not a tablet mode false triggering issue as I have looked into this before and it was not a tablet mode cause. If I do not fix it by flipping my screen back and forth, another way to temporary bring it back to life is to simply turn off my laptop for a while and start it (or remove the battery would definitely do so). Simply by restarting the laptop while the issue is appearing, would not fix it. Sometimes when I was browsing around in the Bios setup page entered by pressing F12 or F2, after I restarted it from those pages, the keyboard usually would be fixed too, sometimes it would not. 

I have tried nearly everything on my side trying to fix it. That being said, I have tried things I can find online such as Dell's Bios update, keyboard driver reinstallation via device manager, sticky keys / toggle keys off, etc., and I have tried multiple clean reinstallations of Windows 10 and 11 (everything gets erased in case there is some applications or corrupted files that are causing the issue). An external keyboard would work, and in the Bios setup page, my laptop's keyboard also would work too even while the issue just appeared from a normal use. After a lot of research and experience, I do not think it is a hardware issue, but anyway I ordered and replaced the keyboard thinking that it might have been that the keyboard's connectors or something were broken. However, the problem persists!!! 

Now, my conclusion is that it is likely either gonna be a motherboard issue, or more likely to be some corrupted files/setups in the Bios system. The reason I suspect that it is likely to be the Bios problm, is because I have been keeping my Bios version up to date from every new release by Dell since I first purchased my laptop. There was no problem for the first 7 months, until one day it started to appear frequently. During that peaceful 7-month period, I had probably had 3 updates for the BIOS from each release. Therefore, I suspect that maybe the newer Bios versions after my original one has all contained some bugs that have been affecting my keyboard. Dell's technicians have been always advising me to update BIOS to solve this issue, but mine is already up to date. Since an update would fix the issue, I wanted to downgrade my BIOS to last year's version before the problem started to appear. But I still have not figured out a way to downgrade it as the normal exe application download and automatic flash process would not succeed as some progress was blocked from proceeding further. Any method to downgrade it? I have heard that a forceful downgrade would be risky as it can make the bios a useless brick though, which is concerning. 

So my questions are: 1. Is a clean install of the windows system completely clean (like can files/bugs/apps still manage to escape from the reset?) 2. Is it likely the Bios problem? 3. What do you think it's likely the causes of it? 4. What are your suggestions to diagnose them and get the problem resolved? Thanks!!!

If you have more questions about some details of the issue, I am happy to share them for you to help further investigate."
New Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 fiasco
"Before I start I need to come clean. I've been Apple user for years. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't mindless drone praising Apple 24/7. I used Apple devices because I considered them as the best **for my needs**. However in past year or two Apple made it clear that I'm not the ""pro"" user. But this is the completely different story I will tell the other day. Let's focus on the new Dell XPS 13 laptop.

When I was escaping the Apple Garden, I've tested bazillion laptops. The one that passed the most of my tests was Dell XPS 17. Despite few shortcomings I still think it was the best choice for me. Once I've replaced my main laptop I've started to look for a replacement for my iPad Pro (M1 version).

Literally, days after I've decided to look for a new tablet, new Dell 2-in-1 laptop was released. The price was similar to the equivalent iPad Pro (including accessories - keyboard and stylus) but instead of a glorified iPhone I would be using a real laptop in a form of a tablet. After checking multiple reviews I got myself a brand new shiny Dell 2-in-1 laptop/tablet.

And this is where the things went sideways. But before I start bashing Dell I need to state that I'm using Fedora Linux. The only moment I lunched Windows was to download new version of Fedora and to save it on a good old pendrive. While theoretically latest Fedora (and Gnome) seems to be ok with touchscreens it takes more than a brave person to say that new Dell XPS 13 laptop is Linux friendly. Let me list all of the issues:

\- Fingerprint scanner doesn't work - despite it's working fine on a new XPS 17 laptop- There's no sound - ""dummy output"" is the only thing I can get (no matter the ""fix I try"")- Forget about suspending your ""laptop"", it will die overnight. It will drain the battery 5-10% per hour. Unfortunately hibernation sucks on Fedora (at least it sucks for me).- Stylus just ""works"". It's more than subpar than Apple Pencil.- Folio is just horrible. There's no way to use it on your laps which sucks due to ""laptop"" branding. I haven't used it but I'm pretty sure Microsoft Surface would be much better choice.- Default folio is just crap. The magnet is so weak that every single time I try to touch the screen when the keyboard is attached, the magnets loose the grip and the whole device just drops on the table.

To summarize. If you want to buy a device that won't work as you would like, get it. Otherwise wait for the drivers or buy something else."

This is relating to their quality assurance and customer service. Unfortunately I do not know where I could share this incident where Dell would bother.

Tldr; Dell exchanges monitors with issues, patch only that issue, and continuously recycles until end of warranty.

Bought a new S2421H back in December 2021, and 10 months in the monitor failed to accept any signal from the PC. Contacted Dell support and they said would do a 1 to 1 exchange. Everything was smooth and they covered delivery. I was impressed until I noticed they sent me an old refurbished monitor. Staff assured that the refurbished are well tested with no issues.

One month in, the film on the screen started peeling off (likely due to poor workmanship or ageing of the monitor). Keep in mind Iâ€™ve only done this purchase less than a year in, the exchanged monitor should not show signs of ageing. Contacted support who promptly agreed to do 1 to 1 exchange. At this point I requested for a new piece as the previous assurance showed no sign of assurance. Especially how I changed a relatively new one with possibly a really old piece. I even offered $ for a higher end model as I thought perhaps low end models have very short lifespan. The staff 100% ignored my question and proceeded with the exchange details. I have spent too much time on this so just went with it knowing never to purchase monitors from Dell. Monitor was exchanged again with an old refurbished set.

One hour in, I noticed the newly exchanged monitor exhibited screen burn. It was so bad you could see it across apps (alt-tab). Before this exchange I was once again â€œassuredâ€ that the monitors are tested. I tried contacting support again who just wanted to do the exchange without addressing at all about their unethical practices of merely exchanging with old pieces, likely hoping the user just â€œbear with itâ€ until warranty ends.

(EDIT: 4 days in, the screen film peeling begin again. Their customer service has since denied any exchange for me claiming that they are awaiting a reply from another team quoted ""Hi, Weâ€™re still awaiting an update from our product engineering team. Weâ€™ll write to you as soon as we hear from them."". Please be AWARE before purchase. I have great experiences with Dell monitors over 20 years, these issues only happen when you are lucky/unlucky enough to buy a faulty piece.)

Two things can be learn from this. The assurance is not true and Dell does not test their refurbished sets, staff are only trained to process the exchange and give â€œassuranceâ€ to facilitate the matter.

Dell (or Dellâ€™s staff) are not concerned of the practice of sending the old monitors to another customer over and over until end of life or end of warranty. They make the exchange quick and hassle free to avoid customer complains well. Most who received the new monitor will not bother to further pry and the issue is swept under the table, as during my first exchange.

Final edit: After about 2 weeks, I brought up this issue again which they have been avoiding, throughout the exchange process.

My reply:
â€œHi, item is well received. Thank you. In any case, I am awaiting an update regarding this. I will take your next reply as Dellâ€™s position on the case.â€
â€œthisâ€ is refers to one of my message above: â€œthanks for the reply, my issue does not narrowly pertain to this monitor. The monitor may be fine, may be faulty, it doesn't matter. Based on the past few experiences, Dell has been sending patched up refurbished monitors, and likely recycling to other customers until it is disposed of. This seems highly unethical as a business strategy.â€

Dellâ€™s reply:
â€œThank you so much for confirming.
Stay blessed.â€

Not sure how to proceed with such a reply from Dell.

How much faster are the 12th generation processors?  Is there somewhere online I can enter in the stats of computers and have it show me exactly how fast they can do things?  Be able to compare them properly to know what to buy and if its worth it?

Dell Inspiron 15 3567 updates
"Hi, i have a Dell Inspiron 15 3567, the version without the AMD GPU, i5-7200u and Intel HD 620.  
I already installed a new SSD, a Crucial MX5 500GB, 16 gb of ram and a HDD caddy in the cd drive to use a HDD as storage.  


I want to known if is posible to make the next upgrades:  
 \>Change the screen.  
My Dell has the 1366x768 screen. IÂ´ve seen there is a version with a 1080p screen, and also i found the screen in some stores. Can i install a 1080p 120hz/144hz screen? Is even worth it to go with 120hz to non gamer use like programming and watching anime, or i just go with 1080p 60hz.

\>Install a new Wifi 6 BT 5.2 card  
Is worth it? Any recomended model? Mine has the qca9377.

\>Install a backlight keyboard  
Is possible? i canÂ´t find any spare port in the mobo. I don't use the trackpad, so is possible to use that port for a backlight keyboard?

\>Install 32 gb of ram

Is possible? Iv'e seen some page, like the official from Crucial that say i can use 32GB of ram.

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance, and have a nice day."
Flash Crucial SSD firmware through PERC 730P Mini RAID controller
"Hi! We've got a number of Crucial drives in Dell r630 servers with PERC 730P Mini RAID controllers that need their firmware updating. The servers aren't live so there is always the option of taking them out of the server, plugging them into a another one with direct SATA connections and flashing them that way. But I just wondered if there's a way of flashing them through the controller. For example, using perccli? 

Thanks"
Looking to permanently close a compromised personal Dell account
"Hi all. So I received two separate emails from Dell saying my email on my account changed from my own personal to some random email that I donâ€™t recognize, and to contact Customer Care if I didnâ€™t initiate the change. Iâ€™ve spoken to at least four different representatives to try to close my account and they keep phone tagging me between Customer Care and Sales. 

I then had two different charges in the past two days on my credit card (last used on my Dell account) for over $700 that was declined by my bank. Iâ€™m just trying to permanently close my account. Does anyone have advice or a phone number where I can actually get it closed so I donâ€™t have to keep going through my bank to dispute these charges? Thanks!"

Upgrading a Dell OptiPlex 3070 Micro (RAM and graphics card)?
"Hi all,  
I purchased a Dell OptiPlex 3070 Micro a few years ago as my work desktop with the following specifications:

*Dell OptiPlex 3070 - Micro - Core i5 9500T / 2.2 GHz - RAM 8 GB - SSD 256 GB - UHD Graphics 630 - GigE - WLAN: 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.1*

 I've upgraded to a 4K dual monitor setup, which slows things down quite a bit. Is it possible to upgrade the specs of this small form factor PC? I suppose the graphics card is the issue, but I'd ideally also upgrade the RAM.

Where can I get just the wire part of the charger?
"A while back the insulation near the plug broke which exposed wires and it eventually stopped working. I fixed it the best I could and it worked for another year or so. Now its back to not working again. I cannot find just the wire anywhere online. Some of the ones I have found had bad reviews saying the wire is too small and gets hot. It seems like such a waste to get a whole new brick and I would rather not pay that much. I am more than capable of soldering on a new cable if I can find it. If anyone knows a supplier, it would be very helpful.

Its a 7.4mm Ã— 5mm plug from a LA240PM160 charger"

Dell Support Issues XPS 15 9570: BIOS Start-up issue
"Hey Iâ€™ve been having some issues for about a year now and I was wondering if anyone else has or if someone has some advice. 
I bought an XPS 15 with the 4 year premium support and after about 2 years started having a BIOS issue come up saying battery critically low when I try and wake my computer up and itâ€™s not connected to power, it then turns off. I plug it in, turn it on, and itâ€™s saying the battery life is over 50% or whatever it was before, and Iâ€™m not having any issues, except now Iâ€™ve lost anything Iâ€™ve had open. 
Iâ€™ve run battery diagnostics and they all come back that my battery is in excellent health. I am up to date on all of the updates from dell. 
Iâ€™ve talked to support for over 40 hours, sent them my computer, and they keep saying itâ€™s a motherboard issue, and that theyâ€™ll swap the motherboard, and they never do. Is there somewhere to escalate or complain? I paid $400 for premium support to make sure my computer would last through school and now Iâ€™m out the money and my laptop only works when plugged in."

Wallpaper Keeps Disappearing when Plugging in Monitor (XPS 15 9560)

Dell Optiplex 7000 USFF Video Issue
"Brand new unit, purchased ~2 weeks ago. 

Windows 10 Pro. Unit has two DP video ports, connected via DP->HDMI Cable (no adapters, just a cable) to two ASUS 24"" monitors.The Dell will only utilize one monitor at a time. I know both monitors are good and both cables are good, because every time I reboot the unit, it switches which monitor it uses. The other one remains black. 

Windows has been updated. 

Video driver has been updated. 

BIOS has been flashed/updated. 

Dell Support was contacted and they remoted in and basically re-did everything that I did, still we have one black monitor. 

Does anyone have any ideas?"
Thoughts on used Dell laptop docking stations?
"Have a Dell 5421 and want to get a docking station. Ebay has a lot of quite cheap older Dell docks (WD15, WD19, TB16) that come with the wall power adapter.

They are cheaper than just buying a 2nd power adapter for the laptop. Used TB16s, for example, can be had for under 50 USD. Thanks!"

"XPS 15 Potentially Damage by 3rd Party Charger, could this be covered under accidental damage?"
"Quite a while ago I dropped my XPS 15 while it was charging and it landed on the charging port with the charging cable still in it, bending it in a way that made it unusable. I ended up using a 3rd party charger (Insignia - Universal 65W Laptop Charger) that I had for another older laptop (that also no longer works, took one to many falls) because I did not have the money to get an official replacement.   


After months of using the charger it became difficult for my computer to recognize the charger. I would have to unplug and re-plug the charging cable a few times into the charging brick at different angles to get the computer to charge. I ordered a new official Dell charger once I had the money, but the laptop would no longer recognize the official charger at all. Now neither of the chargers are recognized by my laptop. I only learned later after the laptop was at 0% charge that using a 3rd party charger can cause damage to your computer.   


 I didn't try to get it repaired because I was no longer in school and didn't need it. I knew the support services I paid for had expired and thought I couldn't afford the repairs out of pocket. I found out recently I could renew the support services which I can afford. Could this issue potentially be covered under the  Premium Support Plus: Accidental Damage Service? I just don't want to reinstate the service and find out later I'll still have to pay more money on top of the support services payment. I plan to finish my degree in the new year and need the laptop functioning again.  


TLDR;  
A 3rd party charger might have caused damage to my laptop and the laptop will no longer charge and I want to know if this issue could be covered under the Premium Support Plus: Accidental Damage Service  


Any help would be appreciated ( :"

Dead volume control on twin S2719DGF monitors
"Using dual S2719DGF monitors with PC and audio output to external speakers. I could control volume fine on windows, and when I wanted to connect a game console or something Iâ€™d just lower the volume with the OSD on one of the monitors (As the external speakers are fixed volume.) I connected my mac to these monitors via DisplayPort and wanted to be able to control the volume through software, so I downloaded [MonitorControl](https://github.com/MonitorControl/MonitorControl) for MacOS, which controls brightness and volume over DDC (display data channel.) Both worked excellently. Changed my setup and used HDMI from mac to monitors, and I noticed volume control was no longer working. Not only that, but volume control with the OSD didnâ€™t work universallyâ€¦ volume is now stuck at 100. Even disconnecting all display cables except one connected to my Switch proves that volume control is still not working. Did controlling my monitor volume over DDC kill the volume control?

"Hey! I've had my laptop for a year now, and after a while I decided that I needed a monitor to make college work easier. I wanted to be able to use a monitor with 144hz or more, so I bought the Dell 27 Gaming Monitor: S2721DGF.

2TB Samsung 970 evo plus nvme successfully cloned into 8th gen i7573
"So with Black Friday I decided against the WD sn570 and instead went with the evo970 plus at $160.  I used the Samsung data migration program with no issues and had the nvme drive in an outboard USB-C.  I know that there has been ongoing debate over the years about what these boxes would take as when released Dell had only tested them up to 512GB or perhaps 1TB, so I wanted to throw into the google search mix that one can get 2TB into the boot slot, and the 2TB in the 2.5"" sata bay has done OK for a bit of time as well.  Not going to upgrade it to 4TB as 2.5"" sata is a dying format.  I did send my old 1TB evo 860 2.5"" to a buddy who still runs his tower off a spinner.

Moving stuff around showed 1.3GB/s transfers between the C and D partitions on the Samsung, and 470MB/s between the Samsung and the 2.5"" sata.

4TB of ssd in a laptop is still a bit surreal, especially since it started life as a brand new $500 open box Best Buy special. 

From about 11/13/2022:

>>  Looking to put a WD blue sn570 2TB in the i7573 to replace and size upgrade the current 1TB sata. I tried to do this with a Sabrent Rocket, but their clone program didn't work with an outboard C box, so I just used it to upgrae the nvme in my asus gamer. Just wondering if anyone knows which clone software comes with WD. I used whatever came with the 1TB sata card to upgrade it from the native 512GB with no issues. The asus clone used the second slot onthe motherboard, whereas the i7573 only has the one m.2 slot and a separate 2.5 bay, currently occupied by a 2TB ssd. <<"

"I have a 240 w adapter for my G5 5500 gaming laptop (accepted alternative 180 w adapter, according to the specs manual), and I would like to know if 65 w portable charger pack like this one: [https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B09QM5P761/?coliid=I237241DM50W7N&colid=36D5JB8HEKD8&psc=1&ref\_=lv\_ov\_lig\_dp\_it](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B09QM5P761/?coliid=I237241DM50W7N&colid=36D5JB8HEKD8&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it), would be able to fully charge my laptop.

Will the 65 w charger fully power my G5 5500 Gaming Laptop?
"So, my Dell G5 5500 gaming laptop can run on a 3-cell polymer (51 Wh) or a 4-cell polymer (68 Wh) battery, and I use a 240 w adapter - the specs say that 180 w is a compatible alternative option to the 240 w. So, my question is would a 65 w portable pack charger be enough to fully charge my laptop, as long as I don't game on it - I'm thinking just watching downloaded movies/tv episodes, that kind of thing.

Also, if I did want to game on the go, how many watts could  I get away with, since I'm on a bit of a budget ($50.00 or less)?"

Upgrading WiFi Card - Dell XPS 15 (9560)

Optiplex 3090 does not recognize Dell P2411H monitor
"As the title says, I have a 2nd hand Dell P2411H monitor (VGA) that I want to connect to a newer Optiplex 3090. It is currently plugged into the TV as the primary display with no issues. Both display ports are working.

When plugged into the Dell monitor alone, the Optiplex does not recognize the monitor. However, when I plug it into both the TV and the monitor, it works as a dual display. Unplugging the TV HDMI causes the monitor to also disconnect. I have ruled out all possible hardware issues (Both DP ports are working, VGA to HDMI is working and the VGA cable is also working). I have also updated the Optiplex to its latest Dell drivers.

It is also worth noting that I have already set the TV as the secondary display, but as long as the two of them are not connected, the monitor will say that there is no input. Anyone with similar experiences? Would like any advice! Thanks :)"

Restocking fee experience for unopened monitors?
"Hello, I searched through Reddit but didn't seem to be able to find an answer. Does Dell typically charge a 15% restocking fee for returns, specifically for an unopened monitor?

How long does in production take for a refurbished laptop
"Ordered a Dell xps laptop a few days ago. Deliver says it should be here by December 7 but reading other threads on here makes it seem like it'll be longer than that since they have to wait for parts? It's refurbished. It should be already there.

I can't cancel and don't mind waiting a few days longer but if it's going to be a few weeks, I'll probably just cancel and order somewhere else."

Stolen Laptop (taken from distributor using my name)
"Hey y'all,

I had a laptop (Alienware m15) that I bought on blackfriday delivered to a distributor in Montreal Canada. When I arrived at the distribution place I was told that someone picked up my laptop with my ID and residence information and also used a receipt they left at my door which I had to show at pick-up.

Anyways my question is if there is anything I can do about this. I've contacted police but will I ever get my laptop back or a refund? Or does dell not offer support for these situations and this is a lost cause?

I'm 2000 cad short and 99% certain the distributor was responsible for the identity and property theft, there is absolutely no way anyone else could have gotten the information necessary to pick-up my package. It was literally picked up minutes after arriving."

How do Dellâ€™s cyber monday deals work? For some laptop modifications those deals arenâ€™t activated
"1. I want to buy Dell XPS 17 inch

RXT 3050 costs 1749$ with this deal. But actually price is 2299$

But with RTX 3060 there is no cyber monday deal. It costs 2499$. RTX 3060 is only slightly more expensive than 3050, but without a sale it all gets pretty pricy

Is it possible to â€œcatchâ€ that moment when there will also be a deal with RTX 3060?

Dell XPS 9370 called it quits
"Keeping this short, I bought a brand new XPS 13 9370 in October 2018. It has the i7-8550u, 16GB LPDDR3, and a 512 GB SSD (Samsung PM981).   
This past February, I was troubleshooting a bug with tech support over the phone, and all of a sudden, after fiddling with the bios, I got a blinking light on the charge light while attempting to reboot.   
It turns out, this was a CPU/mobo error. I paid the 100$ fee, sent it in, and got a call that it would be 400$ to repair as the CPU melted off the mobo. 

TLDR: The concerns this laptop raised about thermal performance in the year after its release are concerning."

IGPU + DGPU on Optiplex 3090's
"Hi everyone! I'm new here so please excuse if I haven't formatted my question correct etc.

I saw a bios switch for multiple displays, but upon trying it, it worked for a bit, then kind of ""shorted out"".

"I was using my computer like normal and it froze. Completely frozen. Mouse wasn't moving. Couldn't hit Ctrl alt delete. Nothing. So I held the power button down and shut it off. Now it won't turn on. I held the power button down for at least a minute. There are no lights on and zero sounds of life on this thing. It's about 5 years old.

I'm pretty familiar with computers as I work in application support but the inner workings is not my strong suit.

Any idea where I should at least start with figuring this out?"

Dell Inspiron 5657 keyboard input lag
"Hello to everyone here I was searching the web extensively and found no solution to this problem so I am now asking for your help 

I have a late 2016 dell Inspiron 5657 which has a bad keyboard input lag problem 
The keyboard is responsive when in bios and during boot but as soon as it goes to windows I have an input lag of about 2-4 seconds between key press sometimes even more
I updated to the latest bios I updated all the drivers from dells website and I tired reinstalling windows around 4 times nothing helped
This problem, also happens during the installation of windows and not just in windows it self
I tried resitting the keyboard connector a couple times and nothing helped
I have never ran into a problem like this and found no solution that worked online
External keyboards work fine and the laptop keyboard works fine in the bios so I donâ€™t think this is a hardware issue
Any help will be hugely appreciated :)"

Monitor S3222DGM - Other Inputs bleed through HDMI Signal?!

BSOD nviddmkm.sys â€œVideo_TDR_Failureâ€ on XPS 15 9500
"Hi there,

I know this might not be entirely Dell related but Iâ€™ve tried so many Windows help guides online and on YouTube to fix it, but to no avail.

I have updated the drivers, then performed a clean install (uninstalled with DDU in safe mode) of the Nvidia drivers - still the same. Followed a few other recommendations in YouTube videos - it still shows BSOD frequently (sometimes every 5-10mins).

Iâ€™m at a loss here and very much fed up as have important deadlines next week and I simply cannot workâ€¦

Also performed diagnostics and no hardware appears to be affected. 
Spent hours trying to figure it out.

The only issue which diagnostics show is:

â€œPCle - Training warning on device PCI Link
Degraded, maxWidth = x8, negWidth = xlâ€

Unsure if this is related but this XPS is already a replacement of a device I had which Dell could not fix (they spent hours trying to do so) so they sent me a new one. It kept getting a screen issue which would freeze it completely or getting weird stripes going across the screen. It was not functional until you pressed the power button. 
Then, this device after a yearâ€™s warranty started getting the same issue - how convenient for Dellâ€¦. And now the above. I am very much fed up with this laptop and brand of tech as a whole. Never had any issues with other laptop brands. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated."

Dell S2716DG monitor DisplayPort connection gets disconnected from PC if I'm on the HDMI input for a while
"Hi all,

I  have a triple monitor setup. The 2 side monitors are portrait mode. (Old ASUS monitors) On  the middle monitor (Dell S2716DG, main monitor) I have both my PC and my Nintendo  Switch connected to it. PC via DisplayPort and Switch via HDMI. When  I've got the monitor on HDMI for an extended period (maybe a couple hours) the displayport connection to PC seems to disconnect from that monitor even  though the DP cable is still plugged in. This screws up my portrait  monitors and turns them sideways and whatnot. Also if I then try to switch back to the DP input it doesn't work. To fix it I have to disconnect the DP cable from the monitor and reconnect it every time this happens.

Is  there a way I can fix this?

FYI the PC is set to never sleep, hibernation is disabled and the monitors Deep Sleep setting is disabled. I'm not sure what else to try"
Is it worth it to buy a 6+ years old Dell Latitude?
"I have previousely had two laptops. The first one, Dell Inspiron 1545 from 2009 lasted almost 9 years, whereas the second one, Lenovo Ideapad 110 I bought late 2018 was super fast and reliable, but sadly, I crashed it on the floor recently and it died.

As I'm planning on building a decent PC for like $1000 within a year or two, I thought it doesn't make sense to spend $500-$600 on a usable laptop just for that short time. So I thought I may as well buy some used one to have a temporary working machine without breaking the bank.

The thing is, in my projected budget of around $100-$120 I see either sth with crappy specs, or some sufficient ones that are however 7,8 or 9 years old. And I know it might be just wasted hundred bucks, bc it might fail every second.

Most of the models I'm considering are Dell Latitude with 8gb ram and intel 4300u-like CPUs that were usually working in companies, so I guess they might have been working for 8+ hours every day, which is heavy.

What do you think is the chance I get to use this sort of laptop for the next 2+ years? Is it really so risky? I've read that post 5 years its over, but on the other hand, my last Dell Inspiron for $500 lasted me for almost 9 years so I'm really confused.

I want to use it as a daily driver i.e. surfing web, libreoffice, movies etc. And I'm a linux user.

A little disclaimer. I'm not from the US, so for me it really makes a difference if I spend on this laptop $100 or $200."

Dell Precision 3561 screen will not turn on when off the dock
"Hi,

I had a Dell Precision 3551 through work, and had to get a replacement which is a Dell Precision 3561. I use a WD19 docking station to power two monitors. This all works fine as with the previous computer.

However, if I take the laptop off the docking station, the screen does not work. The keyboard lights up and I will hear sounds/notifications. If I make keystrokes (such as to log in), then go back on the dock, I will see that it did register that I was trying to log in as the enter Windows password screen will be present.

Additionally, if I boot the computer from off the dock, I will see the Dell logo, but then the screen remains black.

Screen works. Computer works. Just can't find any setting in Windows that would do this. It's almost like it is always wanting to send the video to an external source and I can't pinpoint where that setting is, and I'm not sure if it's a Windows deal or what. Would appreciate any insight, and apologies if this is more Windows related than Dell related."

Inspiron 7620: Noisy fans
"Hi all,

does anyone know why Dell doesnt seem to open up the Fan Speed to be controled by external SW? Not sure why this is being done, butit seems none of the Applications like SpeedFan, Fan Control, MSI Afterburner or similarly are able to detect and therefore control the RPM.

I'm running on a pretty cool laptop, according to CoreTemp temperatures are <= 45Â° and still the fans are considerably loud. So weird. The powerplan says ""balanced"", so Im not running on any performance mode.

WHAT'S THE MATTER?

How to turn them quite...?

G3 17 Gaming Laptop
"I got a Dell g3 17 Gaming laptop, 2 and half years ago I got a notice saying my battery wasn't recognized. Which in a short time killed my battery. About 6 months later I got a new battery, and plugged it in. My laptop would not charge or turn on. So I thought there was an issue with my charger, so I bought another battery and charger at the same time. It would not charge nor turn on, mind you at this time, it had been a year and a half since I last used my laptop. Just recently I got a new dc plugin, since most of my research pointed to this being the culprit. No such luck. It still wont charge or turn on. Now, I don't know what to do outside of going to Best buy or my local computer tech.  Does anyone know what could be causing my laptop to not only not charge but to also not turn on and how would I fix this? 

Please and thank you for any help."

Cost of replacing a headphone jack in an Alienware m15 R6
"I'm out of warranty and the audio jack does not detect my headset. I have tried all the possible software fixes and updates. It is also not my headset since it works through a USB adapter. 

I spoke to customer service online and they asked me to send in the laptop to do diagnostics. 

The hardware diagnostics costs $39 for a 12-15 day turnover and $59 for a 5-7 day turnover. 

I do not want to send it in if it's going to cost some absurd amount. Will Dell also charge me for some other issue that they ""found""? 

Is it also possible for me to just ask them to repair the audio jack without anything else (if there is)?

If someone can give me a rough estimate of how much it will cost, it will be so helpful!!"

Unable to Daisy Chain Monitors
"I am trying to get my monitors Daisy Chained but I am having quite a hard time doing it, I have done a lot of moving around of wires but I think at this point I need to have a bit of a dialogue about it. I have listed my set up below, but please let me know if I have missed anything. 

* Graphics Card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650; Everything I have read seems to indicate this card supports Daisy Chaining.
* Dell U2721DE (Both In/Out DP and supports MST)
* Dell U2721DS (Has DP In, but I do not believe supports MST).

From what I have read, the 2721DS does not need to support MST, but I know that my U2721DE does. I'll try to describe the configuration below:

    GTX 1650 Display Port --> (In) U2721DE Display Port (Out) --> (In) U2721DS
    

When I try to get this set up, my DS monitor does not seem to pick up the signal and instead reads that there is No DP Cable available, going into stand by mode. 

I'd love to get Daisy Chaining set up on the monitors, but man it's tough. Any help would be thoroughly appreciated."
Latitude 7200: does the keyboard work if flipped or removed?
"Maybe a dumb question, but I've never had a tablet 2-in-1 device and just picked up a Latitude 7200 for a good price. I'm assuming the keyboard can't work if removed since it doesn't seem to have a built in battery or BT connectivity, but can it still work if it's flipped to the backside of the device (i.e. tablet mode)? I would like to have it screen down with the keyboard up, then use an external monitor with the 7200 keyboard/trackpad. Or, will I have to use a separate USB BT keyboard/mouse to avoid having to have it set up in ""laptop"" mode? Hope that made sense, thanks"

Dell Optiplex 5090 Micro - M.2 SSD Question
"Hi all, I just snagged an Optiplex 5090 Micro on eBay, and while I'm waiting for it to arrive I have a question about the M.2 slot.

I am planning to use both an M.2 and a 2.5"" SSD, one will be for Proxmox OS and the other for VM disks.

It looks like the 2.5"" SSD might overlap the M.2 SSD when installed, so does the M.2 slot have enough clearance for a heatsink on the M.2 SSD if I am also installing a 2.5"" SSD?

Hoping to order the SSDs this weekend, and didn't want to get an M.2 with built-in heatsink if it will not fit.

Any Optiplex 5090 Micro users out there?"

Need help finalizing the decision between the AW2721D and AW2723DF monitors
"Hello, my first time posting here!

As the title indicates, I've been on a fence between these two monitors, planning to use one for at least 4-5 years, mainly gaming. The price isn't much of a reason, as currently the older AW2721d costs just 40â‚¬ more here in Europe, and with the help of the reviews on RTINGS and elsewhere I'm fairly familiar with differences between the two. Beside the slight increase in max. refresh rate, the most notable ones are **far less overshoot** with the newer model on its Extreme and Super Fast response settings, and **the lack of G-Sync module**, shifting the VRR range from 1-244 to 48-244/280 hz.

In fact, G-Sync module or not is the biggest question here for me. I have a capable computer, running a 3080 GPU, so the fear of fps dipping below 50 isn't (yet) present, and if it were to happen regularly, there would be a new GPU purchase on the horizon anyway. So beside general impressions, I'd like to hear AW2723df users if your VRR experience is the way you expected it to be, as I've read that with some monitors the G-Sync Compatible just doesn't match the G-Sync module's quality standards (having flickering, being not as smooth, even HDR not being as good etc).

What about Overdrive settings?

Any reliability concerns with the module and its cooling fan on the AW2721?

&#x200B;

Your opinion would be greatly appreciated!"
Is a power supply from an Optiplex desktop compatible with an Inspiron?

"Hello,
I was looking at getting a Precision 5770 here soon for some mild CAD and engineering work. I'd like to order it sooner rather than later, since it'll probably take 3 months to get here. 
However, it seems like Dell has discontinued it? Here's the link, 
https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/precision-5770-workstation/spd/precision-17-5770-laptop#javascript:void(0);

 Their exact words are that the ""product isn't currently available"".
I was excited for it, as it's basically an XPS 17 with a GPU supported by Solidworks (Nvidia RTX A3000). 

Is this permanent? Does anyone know when or if it would even be available to get again? 
Dell still sells the 5760, with an 11th gen Intel CPU, instead of the 12th gen in the 5770. I'd really like to not settle for a (new) 11th gen PC, even if it is half the price lol.  

I'm just hoping this is to make way for a ""5780"" with the new 13th gen Intel, I'd be down for that."

Dell D3100 Docking station intermittent black screen how to fix?
"SETUP INFO: I have a Lenovo Ideapad gaming 3 15ACH6 running windows 10 that's connected to a dell D3100 docking station. The docking station has 2 HDMI ports and a display port. All ports are being used in a triple monitor setup. (monitors are a Acer Nitro XZ242Q/size is 24in). The left and Right monitor use HDMI and are at 60hz and the center monitor is using display port at 120hz.

PROBLEM INFO: Intermittent black screen issue only plagues the monitor connected via display port but never the ones connected to the HDMI ports or the laptops screen itself. Problem most commonly appears when playing any video game but once in a blue moon it happens when just using any application that's not a game. The computer does not detect this issue.

I've tried the following with no success.

&#x200B;

\-Installing Display Link software

\-Tried using monitors on eco-mode

\-Reinstalling windows (both 10 and 11)

\-Changing which monitor uses the display port

\-Using games / applications in windowed mode

\-Lowering the refresh rate on DisplayPort cord to 60hz

\-Updating drivers for docking station and laptop (there all up-to-date)

\-Disconnecting the HDMI's cords and only running the DisplayPort cord

\-Changing the PCI power setting (it worked for like 30mins then the problem reappeared) 

\-replaced DisplayPort cord with a DisplayPort to HDMI cord (\*Black screens still happened but VERY rarely however a new more frequent problem occurred where intermittently for about 30 secs while playing a video game the screen would become very choppy looking despite the game saying im at 60fps... This did not happen with the HDMI cords ever.

Lenovo p32u-10 not working with WD19TBS on XPS 9700

No Windows on a Inspiron 17 7537? Just freezes at log-in screen...
"A friend gave me this laptop because 'it's too old' but it still runs fine and has decent specs so was glad to get it.

It runs Linux that was installed just fine but wanted to make it dual bootable so I wiped the HDD and installed Windows 10 which went fine but when it was time to log in the system just freezes after a few seconds. You can power cycle it all you want but the problem remains. The exact same thing happens with Windows 11, no avail.

Any Linux distro it however works fine and I can play a game like Borderlands The Pre Sequel on maximum settings on Steam.

Diagnostic suite quick test was OK, now I'm running the thorough test mode but I doubt it's hardware related. I'm also going to update the BIOS and all firmware where possible.

Any advice?"
S3 Sleep Issue.
D Key on Dell G15 Unresponsive
"Hello,

I have a Dell G15 gaming laptop. I've had this laptop for over a year and a half now. Just this week I've started to notice that the D key on my laptop is unresponsive at times. This is most noticeable during gaming when I am using WASD for movement. My character will get stuck and not move to the right. This is very frustrating and gets me killed sometimes when it happens at the worst moment.

I've removed the key and cleaned out any dust and debris buildup, but this issue is still persisting. It doesn't occur when I am typing, but it seems to be affected by frequent pressing of the W and S keys during gameplay movement. I've also tried exiting a game while the issue is happening, and it does persist for awhile but then fixes itself and the D key is responsive again. I once had to mash D 14-15 times just to get it to type the letter one time after closing out a game. I want to add that the entirety of my time typing this post, the D key has been normal and responsive.

I have tested this across multiple games and it is certainly not a particular game issue, especially considering that it does happen when typing after gaming. What could be causing this issue? If I have cleaned the keyboard properly, what else can I do to try to fix this? I really don't want to resort to buying an additional keyboard or use a controller all the time. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

"Old question that I think Dell never really resolved, wondering if anyone else did.

Just curious if anyone figured how they bricked it and came up with a fix without Dellâ€™s help?

Dell does have a page that says to update to the latest BIOS from 2019. They say it should fix it. It doesnâ€™t seem to for me, anyway.

New XPS 17 (9720) frozen on a Dell update
"Yesterday I got my brand new XPS 17 leptop and I started updating it before I installed anything else. 
First I updated Windows 11 and then moved to Dell's update tool. I had 6 updates in the queue including one BIOS update and one graphic drivers update and an update for the update tool itself. 

I left the leptop unattended for a moment and when I came back the screen was turned off and when I checked the progress the update was frozen. After closing a different window to check if the system is responsive, the screen went black with only the cursor visible and everything frozen. 

After waiting for a while I had to force a shutdown because nothing was responding. 

After Windows loaded I could only see one update available in Dell's tool and it was for BIOS. On the left hand side, I saw ""never"" as the last time an update was applied. 

Later I realised that by default Windows hibernates the laptop after 3 minutes. Not the best thing to happen once you install drivers... This has caused my issue. 

What should I do now? 
Can I check what sort of Dell's updates were installed? 
Should I just continue using the laptop?

DELL S2722DGM monitor color issue

the weird thing is when i move over 50% of the window to my other monitor (PHL 276E7) its changes the color to normal muted blurple on my DELL monitor, but when over 50% of the discord window is on my DELL monitor, it changes back.

i've tried to mess around with the custom color options but nothing seems to help, i can't get it 'just right' and its driving me a little crazy. i'm wondering if maybe its a windows issue? because it doesn't seem to be hardware. either way im not sure how to fix it"

Dell laptop G3 15 3590 HDMI no signal
" 

Hi everyone.

&#x200B;

I borrowed from a friend a Dell laptop G3 15 3590 to do some home working, and tried to display it on my LG external monitor using the HDMI port and it only shows no signal, no matter what i try of what i found on google.

&#x200B;

I told him that and he said the Gforce drive wasnÂ´t working anymore and that maybe the HDMI port was controlled by it and not the Intel UHD 630 drive.

&#x200B;

The specs on this laptop are:

DELL G3 15 3590

* Intel i7 9750H
* Intel UHD 630
* 32GB RAM
* GTX 1660 Ti Max-Q
* Windows 10 version 22H2

&#x200B;

I ask two things then:

&#x200B;

1 - Anyone knows if it's true that the HDMI port is lost because of nvidia card malfunction and the intel 630 doesn't have a say on it?

&#x200B;

2 - If i try to plug the monitor in the usb-c displayport using an HDMI to usb-c adapter will it work, given the graphic cards condition mentioned above?"

Dell G7 7700 - BIOS 1.19.0 - unresponsive keyboard - reset CMOS battery
"At wits end trying to figure this one out.  Keyboard will allow F2 or F12 but once into BIOS or one-time boot settings keyboard is unresponsive.  I've tried external keyboard with same results.  Disconnected  CMOS battery and laptop battery, powered for 30+ seconds and reconnected, no luck.  Tried ctlr+esc + Power for BIOS Recovery but keyboard unresponsive , tried RTC reset with no luck.

Third party pens for Dell laptops
"There seems to be surprisingly little information online (including Google, Amazon and Reddit) about third party pens working well with Dell touch or 2-in-1 laptops.

Could someone who is using any such pen please clarify whether there are any third party pens (preferably with an eraser) that work with (a particular series of) Dell laptops?

One would expect Wacom pens to do so, but that does not seem to be the case, either.

Even the [Dell Pen Compatibility Brochure](https://www.delltechnologies.com/asset/en-us/products/electronics-and-accessories/briefs-summaries/Dell_Pen_Compatibility_Brochure.pdf) is not clear about their own pens, leaving many models out of the supported list."

xps 13 plus oled/fhd resolution - a few quick quesitons
"I'm testing xps 13 plus with OLED right now (so resolution 3456x2160) at display scale of 165%, smallest text size. If I were to pick FHD instead (resolution 1920x1200), to save on battery and avoid babying oled, I could not get the level of font size I'm currently using right? 

In other words, with resolution at 3456x2160, to test what smallest fonts look like on FHD at 1920x1200, since 3456x2160/1920x1200 = 1.8, I test the OLED with display scale at 180%, right? (feels like a dumb question but gotta check my stupidity when considering things I don't normally consider\~)

I'm kind of surprised the OLED and FHD options have such a big resolution difference. My main use is within windows terminal, though I can avoid using the display when not travelling a lot since I have an external monitor.

Also, for OLED, a lot of people hide the taskbar to avoid possible burn in. What about the top menu/tab bar in most applications? The only thing I found was dark mode to change the top bar color. I can't seem to google much on that, most ppl just mention taskbar.

Thanks in advance!"

Upgrading a Dell Precision T1650
"Hey guys new to pc building I got a Dell Precision T1650 from work I want to do little upgrades to it and get playing some games on it.

From what I read I could squeeze a 1650 in it, but I need help on the CPU. The PSU I think an EVGA 700 BR. For the RAM just about any DDR3 up to 32g should work right?

Any help would be appreciated, hopefully I'm on the right track. Thanks"

Image deployment issue with UEFI
Dell Latitude 5420 & WD19S Docking Station works great with second USBC port but not at all with first - is this a problem or is there a technical reason for this that I'm not understanding?
"Alright so I have a fleet of Latitude 5420's & other similar notebooks, and WD15 through WD22TB4 Docks. Now I know I shoulda run WD19TB docks instead of WD19 or WD19s for the offices with 11th gen (tb4) laptops such as the 5420.. but I have a few WD19/WD19S out there. Anyway I have one office with a WD19S and the user has a Latitude 5420 and when she plugs her dock into the second port everything is fine... but NOTHING happens on the first port - so specifically following [this guide](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000182184/dell-latitude-5420-visual-guide-to-your-computer) \- port 1  wont dock but port 2 will - is this a problem I should go to dell for a replacement/repair on? Or is there a mismatch going on here that I don't quite understand that's causing this?

"I am getting 2 Amber and 7 White LED flashing on my Vostro 5320, but screen works fine! Not sure if this is a problem."
"Hello,

I have a Dell Vostro 5320 laptop that I purchased in the UK. It has an i5-1240P processor, 16 GB of DDR5 RAM, a 1920x1200 LCD panel. It is running Windows 11 Pro 22H2 (OS Build is 22621.819)

There is no major issue with my laptop or its LCD screen, and the hardware works fine. However, I still see the ""2 Amber and 7 White LED"" flashing pattern on the charging LED indicator every now and then. This happens despite the LCD functioning perfectly fine. When I Googled the meaning of this LED error pattern, the information I got was that this indicates a faulty/non-functioning LCD panel. And all the posts I found online mention that the LCD panel is not working or turning on. But my LCD panel works fine though. I also noticed that this flashing LED pattern clears up after I shut down and turn on the laptop (i.e. do a complete power cycle rather than simply restarting it).

Here is a video I posted on YouTube to demonstrate what is going on with my laptop: [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/kcsIV-u4vho)

Is there some issue with my laptop that needs to be addressed or can I ignore this flashing LED pattern?

The only issue I have noticed with the display seems to be a software/graphics driver issue in Windows 11 rather than any hardware issue. I noticed that after using my laptop for sometime (over the course of several days, after hibernating and resuming etc) dragging and moving windows in the OS only shows a rectangular outline of the window rather than showing the contents. And the maximise/minimise animation of the windows does not show. This makes it look like something turned off several features in the graphics settings on Windows. And the issue resolves itself after restarting the laptop. Note that this happens on both external monitors and on the built-in LCD display. And this is definitely a software issue and not related to the flashing LED light error code."

"XPS 15 9500 + Debian 11, peace at last"
"I've burned countless hours to figure out how to get Debian working with this beautiful, god-forsaken system and I felt compelled to document how I did it. This is mostly a note to my future self, but figure this will help future weary travelers when they inevitably hit the snags I have.

This is such a pain because the [QCA6390](https://www.everythingrf.com/products/wireless-soc-s/qualcomm/787-914-qca6390) support is in a hellish state between ""completely unsupported"" and ""merged to mainline"" (also known as ""figure it out"" land). It *does* work, but with very specific kernel and driver vesions which I've finally figured out. The kernel included with 11.5.0 just so happens to have been compiled with the necessary flag to load the unofficial firmware which massively simplifies this process (others in the past have needed to clone and compile v5.10 which seems nighmarish without an internet connection).

1. Download and install Debian 11.5.0 (bullseye) using the offline DVD image (load it with [rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) in DD mode on a FAT32 drive (**NOT ""LARGE FAT 32"", YOU NEED A SMALLER DRIVE)**)
2. Format the USB and clone [ath11k-firmware](https://github.com/kvalo/ath11k-firmware) ([this commit worked for me](https://github.com/kvalo/ath11k-firmware/tree/9f285fbc1f7040d0ca6480926d1922b479e2d839)) onto it
3. Boot into the new installation, open a terminal on the USB drive, and run these four commands (adapted from [this 2020 mailing list thread](https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-wireless/msg203111.html)):

&#8203;

    cd ath11k-firmware
    sudo mkdir -p /lib/firmware/ath11k/QCA6390/hw2.0/
    sudo cp QCA6390/hw2.0/1.0.1/WLAN.HST.1.0.1-01740-QCAHSTSWPLZ_V2_TO_X86-1/*.bin /lib/firmware/ath11k/QCA6390/hw2.0/
    sudo cp QCA6390/hw2.0/board-2.bin /lib/firmware/ath11k/QCA6390/hw2.0/

Reboot and you should be able to connect to a network now. Yay!

***BUT DON'T LEAVE. IT'S NOT OVER.***

Because God hates us, when suspending and unsuspending the kernel modules need to be unloaded and reloaded otherwise you'll be offline once you unsuspend.

Luckily, this isn't too bad. Just create the file `/lib/systemd/system-sleep/wifi-fix` (filename is arbitrary) with permissions 755 and the following contents:

    #!/bin/bash
    if [ ""${1}"" == ""pre"" ]; then
      nmcli device disconnect wlp108s0
      rmmod ath11k_pci
      rmmod ath11k
    elif [ ""${1}"" == ""post"" ]; then
      cd /lib/modules/5.10.0-19-amd64/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath11k
      insmod ./ath11k.ko
      insmod ./ath11k_pci.ko
    fi

You might need to play with the path it loads from, but you can easily find the correct path with `modinfo athk11` after a fresh boot.

A few footnotes:

* I haven't actually tested the exact instructions above from start to finish, there might be typos/small steps I forgot
* Ensure VT-D is enabled, Secure Boot is disabled, and your storage mode is *not* RAID before you start
* I have no clue how or *if* this process translates to other XPS machines or even other XPS 9XXX machines. I have a XPS 9500, YMMV
* I *highly* recommend first installing Windows on the laptop and then installing Debian to a separate partition. It makes for a great backup if things go wrong and can even unbrick the network hardware if the firmware becomes corrupted.

9310's wifi died after fan replacement
"**UPDATE (2023-02-02):** It was indeed a bad wifi module. The motherboard had to be replaced. Wifi works after that. Nothing else changed.

**SUMMARY:** One of my cooling fans had to be replaced. After replacement, wifi stopped working. Before this, I had two years straight of dependable wifi during my heavy usage.

All indicators are that my wifi adapter died.

**DETAILS:**

Observations:

* I cannot enable wifi using the traditional way. See below for odd behavior.
* Device Manager says it's fine:

* BIOS says it's not present:

* Intel's Killer Intelligence Center does not see any Killer adapters.

The laptop came with Windows 10. I am now on Windows 11. Either way, wifi has been reliable. I've spent many full workdays solely on wifi, with many video calls or other uses where robust wifi is crucial, and I've had no issues.

Here's what happens when I try to enable wifi. Starting out from a fresh boot, wifi appears disabled when I click on the network icon in the systray:

https://preview.redd.it/voe90pt8hh4a1.png?width=113&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e7f3d0c2dd10a8336baf3069a886285e834e4dc2

If I click on the right arrow above, I can enable it with the toggle (top right):

https://preview.redd.it/1kk4n3nahh4a1.png?width=350&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4810b982eb6f7098aeef3ed68f10fb2488912d68

When I click the toggle the first time, it immediately goes back to the off (left) position. If I click it a second time, it goes to the on (right) position for a few seconds, but it goes back to off eventually:

https://preview.redd.it/1r7t92yihh4a1.png?width=345&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e99c0332b9564c6733d3341dc73b5681c0afa3c5

While it's pretending to enable the wifi device (toggle in on/right position), it shows as not available and grayed out:

https://preview.redd.it/crnuqlzmhh4a1.png?width=110&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6069696c26a01ab09814332d0e9c4723e8d53438

~~Strangely, Battery saver is also grayed out? Not sure if this is relevant or a quirk. I can't recall if Battery saver was not grayed out before the repair. During the fan replacement, the battery was removed and reinstalled. I notice no other battery-related issues.~~ **UPDATE: Irrelevant. It's grayed out because it is plugged in. If I unplug, the option becomes available.**

Removing and reinstalling the battery likely reset the BIOS. I can see an event where the BIOS date/time had to be reset. I don't think that is relevant as that should have reverted settings to default, and the default is certainly that wifi would be enabled. Regardless, I reset BIOS settings to factory default, and that had no effect.

Drivers are up to date, confirmed via Windows Update, Dell Command | Update, and Intel Driver & Support Assistant. Removing and re-detecting the wifi device in Device Manager had no effect. There have been no driver or system updates for days before the fan replacement. The evening before the fan was replaced, wifi was used extensively.

A review of warnings and errors in Event Viewer following a cold boot turns up nothing exciting.

While a little bit of thermal paste ended up on the wifi chip (the repair involved removing and reinstalling the heat sink, which had thermal paste on the bottom), it was otherwise undisturbed by the repair:

https://preview.redd.it/0fzb1bp0kh4a1.png?width=381&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=224ed8948203038e35cbcaad074061af0a729647

I traced the black and white antenna wires to the antennas, and I could see no damage or signs of them being disturbed. That said, even if they were disturbed, a bad antenna wire may impact reception but should not kill the wifi chip.

I booted Ubuntu 22.10 in live mode. Ubuntu does not see a wifi device:

Laptop hardware issues.
"I have an Alienware m15 Ryzen Ed. R5. I've already been through a couple IT support chats, they were really helpful, and right now my current situation is that they'll be sending over an IT to repair my laptop hopefully in the next upcoming days. It works normally except in the past 1-2 weeks it's started to act up... As in, sometimes the display goes black until I refresh it (win+ctrl+shift+b) which was fixed in the first IT support chat via turning off optimus in the boot screen, then I updated my main gpu to play Portal RTX and a couple times a red band about 1/5th of my screen height appear for a few frames, I restarted, before that I had some terrible ghosting effects on Discord & Steam. Right now it's working fine except my laptop doesn't recognize the integrated gpu but just the 3070. I'm really hoping this fix that they'll be coming over in the next few days will fix it. But if it doesn't, since my warranty will last until I think Dec 7th, 2023, shouldn't I be eligible for a full replacement if that doesn't work? I'm just over 340 days.

I'll probably update this post with a comment/edit about my situation after the IT support in the next few days.

FYI: These issues started to occur around 1-2 weeks ago."
Latitude 7530 USB NIC constantly disconnecting
"I have a user that has a new Latitude 7530 and I have not been able to get this laptop to stay wired (Ethernet) despite using multiple USB-C hubs.

It seems to drop back to Wi-Fi randomly and then the user will need to disconnect the hub and plug it back in and it will work for X amount of time. Iâ€™ve used multiple USB-C hub brands and replaced the patch cable from the wall jack but canâ€™t seem to figure out whatâ€™s going on here. There is no NIC so a hub is my only option. Drivers/BIOS are all up to date as of today. Itâ€™s really effecting MS Teams calls.

I came across this post here in which some users have had success with disabling the power settings on the USB NIC so I just did that under the advanced options and hope that will stick but curious to see if others are having this issue as well.

Dell EU customers
"Has anyone tried to buy something on the website of another EU country and have the product shipped to their own?  for example, buy on Dell FR and ship to Dell DE, or PL, IRE... mix and match, you get the idea. 

The products on offer are a complete mess across the board and inconsistent with what models are on offer. Some Items are sold out in one country but not in others which is a tad bizarre as Dell doesn't have stores in the EU, everything made to order is shipped from China. There should be no difference. I know we have different VAT rates, but in some cases the VAT excluded price is different as well.

there really shouldn't be so much of a difference since if it's coming into the EU, it should face only one customs border, the same products should be on offer across the board."

Dell Warranty on an Aurora R8 GPU (RTX 2080)
"Hello!

***TLDR:*** *Replacing an RTX 2080 through warranty. Do they have them in stock? Will it be refurbished? If not then what else as other cards like the 3080 won't fit in the case. What is the shipping/turn around like?* 

The rep I have been emailing with back and forth has stopped responding. I am not too worried about being ghosted as it hasn't been that long. The rep is awesome so far. Very short and to the point. NO BS! I love that.

Basically for years I have had issues with my GPU. No rep would help me. Games would crash, but it was mostly videos. Didn't matter the source either. Youtube, VLC, Media Player, even in game videos too. Sometimes it would stall and blink my monitor(s), other times I'd need a restart. Sometimes a BSOD. Nearly 4 years of this! Finally the rep I got a hold of a couple days ago ran some different tests. Nothing came up. He did the typical uninstall and reinstall, bios updates, all that jazz. The problem was still there so a day or so later they asked me to run another test on my RTX 2080. This test showed an internal error. I sent the screenshot and invited them to take a look on my PC if needed. They told me they'd issue a replacement!

I'm just trying to figure out the process and what I may receive. As in, will it be refurbished, new? Will shipping take long?

One of my worries is it gets upgraded. Weird thought right? Well the issue is the RTX 3080 does not fit in the case without modifications (some people literally carve stuff out and replace the fan with a smaller one). Will they still have RTX 2080s in stock? If not what happens? I've had several Dell's before. All had minor issues I fixed myself. This is the first time I am using their warranty services.

Thanks all!"

Basic warranty coverage?
Hey everyone.  I just received a monitor replacement for one that I bought about 5 months ago however I only had the basic warranty which states that accidental damage replacement is optional (aka not covered).  I've stated in my conversation with them that the damage was due to impact and they submitted a ticket to ship a replacement anyways which I'm happy about BUT I'm wondering if they could potentially charge me later for the replacement once they inspected the device and notice that the damage was done via accidentally damage and not due to a manufacturing defect.

I opened a support ticket with Dell today and they confirmed that the machines need to be updated to 1.23.2 to resolve this issue for good.

"I am looking to buy a used Dell Precision 5530 on eBay as an engineering machine - they seem fairly reasonably priced and easy to work on for their specs.

I am aware that the 5530 has an option for a 57Wh battery with a 2.5"" drive slot, as well as a 97Wh option without the drive slot.  I'm only interested in a unit with the larger battery, but I am unsure as to how to tell what any particular unit is spec'ed as when looking at listings on eBay.

I would guess that the Dell service tag would lend some help there, but most listings are generic and/or don't list or show a service tag for a particular machine.  I will plan to reach out to sellers before purchasing to be sure, but I suppose what I am mainly asking is if anybody knows of a viable method for identifying battery spec (i.e. along side a certain CPU/GPU/Display spec), or if the service tag can be checked for the battery spec.

Thanks in advance!"
"What is this thing with new dell laptops and Thunderbolt? When Windows enters the login screen, the usb and wired nic won't work. This is way too common!"
I was once a Windows monkey...
"I read about all the problems folks are having with Dells. It s unfortunate. I ve owned 4 different Dells. One laptop, and 3 tower computers. A Precision T7400, (old collage cad computer), An Optiplex 7040, (old business computer), A XPS 8940, (My current puter), and a Precision 5520 laptop. All came with Windows except the laptop. It came stock with Ubuntu. I had my share of problems with them all, and most were software issues. As time went by I decided to give Linux a try, (and I ve never looked back). All of the computers eventually had Windows removed, and Linux installed. I even removed Ubuntu from the 5520, and Installed Pop OS. All of them ran better when their drives were wiped, and a new Linux was installed. I don t know if it s just certain models, or the lower tier systems, but in my case getting the factory crap off, and installing Linux was the solution. I ve not had a problem with any of the computers for ages."

Multidisplay and desktop bugs and crashes
"I have recently bought a laptop dell g15, and during its use i started to notice a ton of bluescreening and errors. I have another monitor and if i use it and watch videos or something very simple it sometimes freezes fir a moment and then resets the display in the laptop monitor and in the other one, sometimes it just turns off the display in the laptop and stays off, also when i turn it on it can sometimes start all black and it only shows the backrground image once i select over it, like in the picture shown. I think it has something to do with the integrated but i dont really know, i have tried reinstalling the drivers but it doesnt seem to work, maybe i am missing somethong. Does anybody else has this problem or knows of a possible solution? my model is a dellg15 with rtx3050ti and amd ryzen 7 6800 with radeon graphics"

"SSD needs storage drivers, clean windows install USB via Rufus and windows Iso. Please help"
"Dell latitude 3420. Replaced the original 256 Gb M2 Nvme SSD with a 1 tb Wd nvme SSD.

Downloaded an iso from Microsoft, used Rufus to put it on a boot disk. All went well. 

Checked the bios and the 1 tb drive shows up just fine. 

Booted and got into windows setup via the USB and my SSD isn't showing up there, it's telling me to locate and install storage drivers? 

It's confusing me, finding the drivers is becoming a task from my phone. 

I know I should've used the creation tool but at the rate it was going it looked like it was going to take 2 days to finish downloading windows, not sure why as the iso downloaded in an hour or so. 

Would going back and using creation tool solve it, or should I just add all my Dell drivers to the USB along with Windows and give it another shot? 

Any advice is appreciated and also, thanks so much to everyone that helped on my last question, I'm so close to having it solved. At least everything else went smoothly and the new drive is indeed recognized. 

I suspect it may possibly be formatting, but pressing shift + F10 during installation isn't doing anything. Any other way to format without windows installed?

Update: got it figured out thanks to everyone in this community and r/pctechsupport thanks so much everyone! 

New SSD works great and I've plenty of space now compared to that measly 100 gigs I had to begin with before (how could I possibly be left with just 100 gigs with only windows installed SMH, was it RAID being enabled? I read that raid mirrored two drives and would make 2 128 gb drives show up as a single one, would it do anything similar to one single 256 GB drive, only giving me half the space? Idk it's new to me.

 Anyway thanks so much to everyone that took the time to help! Got it set up this morning and am having a ball downloading random things and not having to worry so much. Low storage space basically cripples a PC imo, it made everything feel so limited."

Blue screen with no error message at boot up?
"okay so i posted here before about how my dell 15 7590 kept bluescreening at boot up, prolly due to a bad windows update installation, and ended up fixing that by (saving my data and) resetting it. it worked fine for some days but then it started doing that thing where the dell logo shows up, there isnt even a loading symbol and it just goes to complete blue screen with no error code or anything and shortly after turns off. 

some information that might be helpful to paint a better picture:

all of this, including the first blue screening problem, happened after i had to remove my bloated battery and just ran it over the charger cable bc i didnt have money for a new battery. also, when i do pre boot system performance check now, it only tells me my battery is missing and nothing else.. so im not sure how to check if its a hardward problem

also, when i plug in my laptop and turn it on, the following happens: first time i try to turn it on, the screen remains black for some seconds, then a horizontal line flickers across the screen and it turns off. when i try to turn it on again, it boots up with the message that time and date arent set, which i think is due to my battery not being inserted, from what i understood.



Im an amateur but is there anything i could do to save it on my own/could i just reset the pc or would that make things worse? since my data is safe on a harddrive i dont care if i have to completely reset it again, i just dont know if its a software or hardware problem aka if i can fix it myself somehow by resetting or should send it to repair once i can."

Dell Optiplex 7040 SFF GPU
"I have an Optiplex 7040 (i5-6500 w/ AMD R5 340). I took out the AMD R5 340 and am currently running Plex Media Server (w/ PlexPass) on it.

"XPS 15 9560 - Replaced battery, still have amber flashing light"
"I bought my XPS 15 9560 in 2017 and used it thorughout college. I recently got the amber flashing light (on the front battery charging indicator), and looking it up I found that this means ""bad battery"". I check my battery report and found that the battery was depleted to 32,000 mWh capacity of the original total capacity of 97,003 mWh. Ever since I got the flashing amber light, my laptop doesn't power on without plugging into the wall, and the laptop shuts off once unplugged.

I figured this means I should replace the battery, so I replaced it recently with a genuine Dell 97,003 mWh battery, and when checking the battery I see that the capacity has been increased back up 97,003 mWh.

After this though, my laptop still shows the flashing amber light, and only powers on when connected to the wall, and shuts off if unplugged. Because the battery capacity is back up, I guess the battery is working well, but maybe some other component is causing issue now? I'm not sure what to do from here."

Latitude 5400 WWAN upgrade
"Want to install an LTE card to 5400. So, have a couple of questions:

What is the best bang for a buck for me, if a strong and stable connection is more important, than ultra speed (I think Cat6 LTE is enough for me to work)?
2. As I know, all abovementioned cards don't provide 2g fallback, but only 3g. Does it matter when the cell network is very weak?

Dell G15 5515 Screen Tear Issue
"Most of the time I open my laptop, I will see this screen tearing (or whatever this is called). I'm unsure when the issue began exactly but I believe it was around a month ago, and I think it has taken a bit longer to get rid of the pixel error recently. I didn't drop it or spill anything on it. It usually goes away after 10ish seconds and my laptop functions normally afterwards. Once though, a few days ago, my screen went black and blinked on and off for a bit before showing this weird pixel mesh over about 75% of the screen (top 25% was fine). I shut it down and rebooted it without issue, although I found that both my RTX 3050 and the built-in radeon graphics were both disabled the device manager. The RTX re-enabled without issue, but the re-enabling failed the first time with the radeon graphics. Has anyone had a similar issue to this and know how I can fix it? Additionally, I'm a student currently with finals coming up, so if its an issue that needs to be sent in for repair is required, is it a problem if I continue to use it for about a week? This is my first time posting on reddit so sorry for any formatting or post errors, and let me know if additional computer specs are needed and/or more pictures/videos of the problem. Thanks.

Vertical lines on screen when using Thunderbolt dock at 144hz
"I just started having an issue with my thunderbolt dock where whenever I plug in my personal computer and change one of my monitors to 144hz, the display glitches and shows vertical lines on the screen ([picture from phone because they don't show up on screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/JYVeBbL)). My external monitors used to run at 144hz perfectly but only recently after I updated some drivers this issue started. I have tried updating all the drivers for both the dock and my laptop but neither has fixed it. 

The issue does not happen when I use my work computer with the dock (also a dell, and a much worse one). I can run my monitors at 144hz without issue. The lines only happen when I have my personal computer. They also go away when I reduce the monitor to 120hz. 

I have ruled out the cables and the monitors. Both run 144hz through the dock on my work laptop without issue. So there must be something going on between my personal laptop and the thunderbolt that prevents it from displaying 144hz properly.

Any advice would be appreciated, I'm considering rolling back my drivers or resetting my BIOS.

XPS 7590 i9-9980HK/1650/AX200 model experiencing huge lag spikes in online gaming
"Hey guys, hope everyone's well. Got an amazing 7590 i9/1650/4K OLED I picked up for Â£580. Alongside a Â£79.99 Core X arriving shortly before Christmas(fingers crossed) and a 3090 FTW3 I'm keeping from a desktop I'm parting out, I'm hoping it'll be a workstation power house. I've got some PTM7950 on the way to repaste the CPU & GPU as well. With all this said even the performance undocked/as a laptop is good enough for 1080p60fps low on MW2 so I'm super happy. Just one issue; the connection is abysmal. I'm playing on my 5GHz band extremely close to the router, just one room away and I get a ton of dropped packets and lag spikes. Playing on my PS4 Pro has nowhere near as many issues wirelessly on the same network and there's a floor of wood between the two since it's upstairs and the router down. I'm somewhat suspecting it's the WiFi card but I can't be certain - I nuked killer wireless and instead went with the stock intel ax200 drivers. This SOMEWHAT alleviated the issue but hasn't fixed it. Could anyone with an AX200 based XPS system, or 7590 if at all possible, chime in and let me know if they face these same lag spikes? If it's just in the nature of WiFi gaming(been a LOONGG time since I've played like this and only cause there's no ethernet port) then I won't fret over it, but if it is then I'd rather know now so I can buy a replacement AX210 or 211. FWIW I've got a USB hub with ethernet on the way since the Core X won't provide extra hubs so I'll be using ethernet once it's fully docked up. Thanks guys!"

5570 Mobile Precision - adding another NVMe SSD to MotherBoard - easy? Possible? Cables / ribbons connecting base cover panel?
"Hey everyone,

As titled, I got a 5570 Mobile Precision this summer + want to add a 2nd NVMe SSD to it.

I've read mixed / conflicting information and/or I'm unclear how easy it is or isn't to remove the base cover.

[Dell's Service Manual for the Mobile Precision 5570 states:](https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-us/precision-15-5550-laptop/precission_5550_sm/removing-the-base-cover?guid=guid-84cf8e6c-abbb-4aa2-bbf8-62408a49eb6c&lang=en-us)

&#x200B;

\>CAUTION: The base cover is preassembled with the audio-daughter board. The pins at the bottom of the base cover are fragile. They ground the antennas and audio-daughter board. Place the base cover on a clean surface to avoid damage to the pins.

And the accompanying image (should show in above link) shows what appears to be some sort of a very fine & delicate cable or ribbon in / on / possibly connecting the base to the MoBo.

Can anyone confirm if this is the case?

Is it as relatively simple as carefully popping off the bottom / base cover of my 5570, inserting a 2nd NVMe SSD, then carefully reassembling, or are there cables / ribbons connecting the base cover to the PC somehow?

Again; it's not clear to me from the service manual if I need to watch for a cable / ribbon or not...

Minor detail, but also;

I think I know the answer, but is there enough clearance inside the laptop for an NVMe SSD with a small factory metal heat sink attached, or no?

Can / should I at least get a thin thermal pad to place ontop of either / both SSD's when I take this guy apart?

Please & Thank You!"
12th gen G15 Laggy Chrome ideas?
"This laptop: G15 5520, 165hz 1080p screen, 12700H (6p/8e/20t) with 32+8GB ddr5= 40GB + 1TB gen 3 nvme (stock), rtx3060. Replacement for a 4 year old G5 5502, 60hz 2160p, 8750H (6c/12t) with 32GB ddr4, 512GB ssd, gtx1060 maxq.

I am a tab hog, mostly for work. My old laptop on balanced mode, with a simple chrome plugin to suspend unused tabs, could handle a thousand tabs seamlessly across two dozen browser windows, no delay in opening new tabs, no slow response to typing, no laggyness at all. Low fan activity.

With the new G15, Chrome lags multiple times per minute on 350 tabs even when not switching tabs, even while writing this, with all other tabs suspended. Fan ramps up and down constantly.

Things I've done to fix the problem: swapped one 8GB ddr5 for a 32GB. Disabled intel graphics. Set My Dell/Thermal to Ultra Performance. Imported the High Performance plan into Power settings. I've messed with every processor setting in bios; c states, hyperthreading, turbo boost modes, turning off e cores (actually does seem to help a little).

Right now, cpu usage is at 3.6ghz, 6% usage, 8 or 10 cpus are parked, less than 12gb ram in use, and chrome still lags.

My backup laptop is a 15in inspiron 1165g7 with 16gb ddr4 and in chrome even it runs circles around this G15. It's absolutely maddening.

Anyone have any idea what I can do?"

Repeated 3.5mm Headphone jack issue on Alienware X17 R2
"I bought an Alienware X17 in August. Two months into it the computer started having issue with the audio jack. When I plug in a headphone the sound is distorted, sometimes cutoff. Like watching a basketball game but you can only hear the announcer talk and nothing else. I have used different headphones and different devices to test so itâ€™s definitely the Alienwareâ€™s issue. Called Dell support, the guy remotely reinstalled my sound drive to no avail. Sent in a technician to switch up the motherboard and itâ€™s still didnâ€™t work. They were suggesting either I had to mail my computer to a Dell repair center or I can do a system exchange and get a new one. To avoid the hassle of shipping my computer back and forth, I chose an system exchange and got a new X17 R2.

Thing stared out great but now the same exact issue happened. Called Dell support again. The support person uninstalled my sound drives and attempted to restart the computer, but the entire system crashed and showed blue screen. Now I had to back up my data before reloading the system on my computer and itâ€™s taking forever. I am very frustrated and am starting to doubt the quality of Alienware and Dellâ€™s brand name. Has anyone ran into the similar issue here?"
Dell Precision 5510 random screen locks with bios versions > 1.21.0
" 

I've tried upgrading to both version 1.22.0 & 1.23.0, but both seem to get random screen lockups. This can occur when the the screen is on and the mouse cursor is still movable but nothing else responds; as well as if the screen powers off per the Windows 10 *Power Options*. If the screen power off occurs when the screen powers off it doesn't come back on if I type on the keyboard or touch the touchpad/mouse, but if I use the power button to sleep then un-sleep, I get a black screen with mouse cursor which is movable. In either case I need to force a hard shutdown by pressing the power button down for 20 seconds or however long it takes.

This is occurring with an up-to-date Window 10 laptop. I even re-installed Windows 10 a couple of weeks ago thinking that it may have been the issue, but the problem still occurs. Only downgrading the bios to 1.21.0 which doesn't seem to have the issue.

Anybody encounter the same problem? Any known ways to fix or workaround?

Thanks in advance."

I was recently given a Dell Latitude 5500 without a charger by a friend. Could I use the same charger I use with my Alienware 15 r3? The connector fits and both machines use chargers rated at 19.5 volts. The only difference is in wattage and current. According to Dells website the stock 5500 charger runs at 65 watts and 3.4 amps and my Alienware one runs at roughly 240 watts and 12.3 amps. Will this discrepancy damage the Latitude?

"T550 - switch from H355 to H755, getting weird error now"
"New PowerEdge T550 (ST:  [GFH3QR3](https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/product-support/servicetag/0-V2FCWFZsSDdlbmx2TXdtRURXRzNjUT090/overview)) arrived late last week, 16 SAS drives (eight on Backplane1, eight on BP3), 2 x PERC H355 Front SAS HBAs, all working fine when machine was delivered.

Changed upper (BP3) HBA from 355 to 755 'cause the client needs RAID10 - now getting weird (i.e., not really well-documented) error on powerup:

**iDRAC Settings: HWC8010: The System Configuration Check operation resulted in the following issue: Config Missing:  Float Card  Front Perc/HBA**

Can't find anything about this mysterious ""float card....""

The machine will still ***manually*** complete booting into Win2022 Hyper-V mode on the RAID10, but I don't want to have to manually intervene each time the machine needs to reboot.

Dell support is looking at this - four days now, they're truly mystified but haven't given up. I'm wondering if anyone else has seen this, and has a suggestion as to how to make it go away.

I've asked Dell Support if there's an iDRAC inventory program that needs to scan the system to just make this message go away - too early to have gotten a cogent response on that point. I've setup iDRAC to inventory on each reboot and still find this to be quite the persistent message....

Thoughts? Anyone else seen this before? Nothing really informative in the couple of pubs in which I've finally found this message. I privately suspect Dell Support is going back to the iDRAC engineers to see what the code looks like in which this message is generated....."

Trying to chain 2 (eventually 3) Dell monitors to a laptop AND a desktop PC
"NOTE: the title is the TL;DR but just a note that I want a switch between the desktop and laptop, which lets monitors, keyboard and mouse work on either at the press of a button.

â€”â€”â€”

Hi guys, first time trying to do this so apologies if I don't quite get it. I come from a generation of using VGA's then just HDMI's so I'm in uncertain territory for me. In my 37 years I've only ever used one monitor at time and it's only been the Dell [U2414hb](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-24-monitor-u2414h/apd/860-bbcg/monitors-monitor-accessories) for the last 8 years.

Started a new job from home which covers a lot of different content simultaneously this year so have needed to use more than one, and received 2 Dell [U2422H](https://www.dell.com/en-uk/shop/dell-ultrasharp-24-monitor-u2422h/apd/210-ayui/monitors-monitor-accessories). From work I also received Dell [Inspiron 16 Plus](https://www.dell.com/en-uk/shop/laptops/inspiron-16-plus-laptop/spd/inspiron-16-7620-laptop/cn76302sc) in addition to my custom video editing PC which the monitors connect through my [4GB Sapphire Radeon RX 580 NITRO+](https://www.sapphiretech.com/en/consumer/nitro-rx-580-4g-g5) graphics card.

My plan is to connect all three monitors (U2414hb will remain portrait for document work) and switch between the PC and the laptop, depending on work or personal use.

It took some tinkering but I managed to connect to my desktop the U2422 monitors via the display port cables that came, and am looking for my U2414 box to pull that DP cable also. However, when I tried to connect the laptop, I could only connect it by HDMI and only one turned on with the DP cable going between the two monitors. I don't have more HDMI's so haven't been able to try connecting like that, and it feels like there going to be a lot of cables if that's how it's gotta be set up.

I spoke to a friend who said he bought a switch that connects things like multiple omputers to the same monitors, and recommended this same switch to me - [this one](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/aw/d/B01N6GD9JO). When it came though, I realised it's just USBs and I don't simply get it at this point.

I've asked him, he just keeps telling me to connect it all by USB, and I explain to him I can't seem to connect by USB to either laptop or desktop and he explains it works for him. I've tried connecting by USB/USB-C from my monitors daisy chained to my laptop and I don't think that works anyway. I've looked only and the videos I find just mention the ports but then don't actually show which ports they used and have been unhelpful for me.

It's becoming a little frustrating. I just want to be able to use the laptop for work, and desktop for personal use, and press a button to share the same monitors and wireless keyboard mouse at the same time.

Can someone help give me a more simple explanation of what to do and what to stick where, as well as what switch would be ideal and purchasable here in the UK.

Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!

Washed out Monitor through HDMI
"Heyo i just started running 3 monitors, but I noticed my monitor hooked up through HDMI on my dock is washed out, but the other two are fine.

Below is my setup and troubleshooting steps:

&#x200B;

Hardware:

* Laptop: Latitude 5431 - i5-1250P with iGPU
* Docking Station: WD19TBS dock with 2 DP ports and 1 HDMI ports
* 3 Dell P2419H.

Troubleshooting done:

* Swapped the HDMI cable for a new one (Have done this 3 times to rule out brand issues).
* Plugged the HDMI cable into another monitor. The issue follows the HDMI cable.
* Bypassed the dock completely and plugged a monitor directly up to the laptop. Same issue.
* Got a new laptop (same model) but the issue remained.
* Replaced the dock with the same model.
* Plugged the hdmi monitor up using DP cable, the issue went away.
* Only had the hdmi monitor hooked up to the dock, with no other monitors hooked up. Same issue.

&#x200B;

The issue seems to only happen when the display is running off HDMI, but the dock only has x2 DP ports so I am stuck with HDMI. I have swapped out every piece of hardware in this puzzle, and the only consistent fact is the issue happens when something is plugged into the HDMI port,  whether thats the dock or directly to the computer. I only had 1 other model of monitor to test with, another Dell monitor, and the issue remained. I do not have another model of computer to test right now.

&#x200B;

I contacted Dell but they ghosted me after it went up to Level 3. If you have ever hooked up a monitor to a gaming PC and saw it washed out, and found out you had to go into nVIDIA settings and set the dynamic range to full, its almost the same issue here, but Intel graphics does not have that option anywhere.

&#x200B;

Any help would be appreciated. The monitor works its just extremely noticeable and hard to read text as it seems there is a transparent 'filter' over the screen. Thank you!"

XPS 9560 suddenly thinks 130 W charger is 90w
"I have a 130W Dell USB C charger I have been using for a couple of years and suddenly I get the following BIOS warning when I boot up: ""You have attached an undersized 90W power adapter to your system which is less than the recommended 130W power adapter...""   I can hit F1 to reboot and finish startup, but every subsequent restart has the same warning.  As far as I know, nothing has changed in either the charger or laptop from before.  I tried unplugging both ends of the charger, then restarting with the plug back in, thinking there might be some temporary glitch in the charger.  I've tried initially booting on battery, then booting again plugged in, but no change.  I don't see any settings in BIOS that might effect it.  Is it the charger, somehow malfunctioning, a laptop setting, or perhaps something malfunctioning on the laptop side (perhaps the USB C connector)?  I know this laptop is getting a bit old, but it has still generally run well (except for the original barrel charger connection, which stopped charging a while back, leading me to switch to USB C charging)."
MaxxAudioPro does not detect headphones at times

It gets very annoying and is only fixed with a reboot. 

I have the latest sound driver for my device (according to the Dell website) and the latest version of MaxxAudioPro. Any idea on what might be causing this problem, and how I can fix this?"

Alienware center question.
"So I bought my laptop a year ago, and it came with all the goodies installed, including alienware center thing, which was important for one sole reason. It had a game mode.

GPU: NVIDIDA RTX 3050  
RAM: 8GB

Now I had to install new windows, because my laptop slowed down a lot, I however have lost alienware thing due to me formating my ssd.

I have been trying to find it to download the app, but can't seem to find how to do that. If anyone can help, I would really appreciate it."
Laptop graphics card preference

As i'm a student with big exams coming up very soon this is very bad for me.

Dell 5040mt upgrade w/ potential faulty RAM slot
Bought a 5040mt i7 6700 to upgrade and upon arrival I got the dreaded amber colored power light flash during first boot attmepts. Upon some trouble shooting i found if I put the stick of ram in slot 1 instead of 2 it would boot. Seller had the ram in slot 2 and claimed the pictures he took of the bios was in that configuration (no reason not to believe him because why else would he take pics having it in slot 1 then move it to slot 2 to ship). Went ahead and installed windows on the crucial p3 nvme i bought for it w/ ram in slot 1. I have a 2nd matching stick of ram coming and an MSI 1650 ventus xs 4g oc. Is this an indicator that slot 2 is faulty? in that case am I going to be burnt on dual channel or can I just use slots 1 and 3?
U2723QE auto input not working
"Hello,

Recently got U2723QE and the auto input change isn't working.

I have two laptops connected:

1. Macbook pro 2021 with M1 pro chip - via USB C to C
2. Asus Zephyrus G15 - via HDMI

When I place the Macbook to sleep and turn on Asus the monitor is blank.   
When I click on the joystick button on the back, it says no USB C input found, and I have to manually change it to HDMI input.  
Then If I shut down the Asus and turn it back on, it says no HDMI input found and I have to actually turn off the monitor and turn it back on to recognize the HDMI.  
When I wake the Macbook, there's no problem switching to USB C input.

I have searched online and there's a lot of people on Dell's website having same problem, but no solution.   
Does anyone know if this is a setting issue?

FYI -  I also have the older monitor U2720Q and it has absolutely no issue switching inputs automatically between the two laptops.  
Frustrated that it's a newer model and it's having issues that my older monitor never had."

it's really hard to see even 90 degree. 

The GPU is 60 degrees under load, so i can't notice much difference.

Advice concerning dell support assist.
"Hey guys, I got an alienware r12 a few months back. I use it exclusively for gaming right now. I have windows 11 and try my best to keep everything updated. I got an Xbox controller a week ago or so and initially I connected it to my computer via Bluetooth and everything worked great no issues whatsoever. A couple nights into using my new controller I noticed issues connecting it to Bluetooth and suddenly it was as if Bluetooth is gone off of my computer. When I go to connect the controller it says couldn't connect. When I run the troubleshooter it tells me there are compatibility issues. Note that I did 0 updates before or during this time. The issue seemingly popped up out of nowhere. So naturally I looked into the simple fixes. Restarts, updates, etc and nothing worked. Then I went into the device manager and saw the Bluetooth drivers or software or whatever it is so I know its there. Looking for more ways to solve the issue I updated drivers and bios from the Dell website but have nonstop issues when trying to download or use support assist. I had to do the updates manually. When I try to download support assist I always either get an error message or the computer outright crashes on me. So firstly my question is what do you guys think happened to my Bluetooth? And secondly is support assist necessary on my pc? I can update things manually but keeping track is a pain. Sorry for the long post but im not the biggest tech wiz in the world by far so im not sure what to do. Thanks in advance for any advice."

"I have a Precision 5570(i7 64gb 1200p a2000), these are identical to xps 9520, through work, I've tried talking them into windows 11 and it's a no so my CPU does not run as effenciently as it should with e cores under Windows 10. To compound that running literally anything causes my dedicated GPU to run and I can almost never get it back off. I once opened one tab on chrome (Firefox used more power...) and closed it which resulted in dedicated GPU to stay running afterwards?!?!? 

Just as title says I've tried all sorts of things like updating the Nvidia physx settings disabling hardware acceleration in Windows and chrome. Messing with dells power management. Though I have a feeling just running moba, workBench, pycharm or Linux vm's will cause it to come on anyways.

I want to find a clean way to disable the GPU when on battery power cause sometimes I have to be at a customers site away from power or just sit on my couch and work  a little. I currently get 2hrs on battery which is worse than my old 3530 at any point in it's life. I work for a small company and I'm a developer so I have most admin privileges or I can get one of our sys admins to log in so any ideas can be tried."

Can I Track My Missing Computer???
"Ordered a customized Dell XPS 8950 three weeks ago from the Dell website.  After much delay the PC was shipped from Dell on 12/03 with expected delivery for 12/07.  Received another notification from Dell stating the revised shipping date would be 12/05 with an estimate delivery date of 12/12.  Soon after that received another e-mail from Dell stating the anticipated ship date would be 12/06 with an expected delivery date of 12/09.  Yeah I enjoyed that 3 ring circus of delivery dates right there.

Received tracking notice from Dell on 12/06 and FedEx updated the notice to state delivery would be on 12/08 instead of 12/09.  12/08 passes and no delivery.  Checked the tracking number and my PC has been on a truck for delivery since 5:30am on 12/08.  Waited all through the weekend hoping it would be delivered and nothing.  Current FedEx tracking status on their site states ""package out for delivery"" with a ""pending"" scheduled delivery date but it's had that status since 12/08.

Contacted Dell and logged a service ticket for the package, so I'm waiting for them to contact me back. However it looks like FedEx may have lost or misdelivered my package.  So I guess what I'm wondering in the event FedEx misdelivered my new PC to a wrong address and someone got themselves a new PC for free, is there a way to track that PCs location?  It's a home PC and I got the free (basic) support so no GPS tracking inside that computer like with work PCs purchased from the site.  So I'm wondering if there's a way to track it once someone hooks it up and turns it on?

I know I'm thinking of extremes right now but something to me doesn't seem right if it's been on a truck for a few days now and has not been delivered, especially since on the delivery date (12/08) I had received a text message from FedEx stating the delivery would be made the same day.

Any thoughts?"
Question about Precision lineup
"I deal with large datasets and need to up my current 11th Gen i7. Looking at Dells current workstation lineup, Iâ€™m not fully understanding some key differences here. Iâ€™m not an expert but I understand Intels processors and when I am unsure, I use CPU benchmark to check.

Is there any real difference between the 3000 and 5000 series? Iâ€™m seeing several laptops that share internals from what I can tell but I am seeing price differences that donâ€™t make sense. Between these two, $500 more for a smaller but slightly higher quality screen but same performance?"

Dell Inspiron 16 Plus 7620 not recognizing WD19TBS
"Hi, sorry if this issue has been solved elsewhere, but I've scoured the sub and can't find the answer.

&#x200B;

I have a new Inspiron 16 Plus 7620 with Thunderbolt 4.0. I purchased a Dell WD19TBS dock with 180w (130w delivery). I understand this is a Thunderbolt 3.0 dock, but I was under the impression that it would support a laptop with a 4.0 port.

&#x200B;

When I plug the dock into wall power, it whirs briefly and then goes quiet. When I plug it into the laptop, nothing happens. My connections (ethernet, DisplayPort monitors, keyboard, etc.) are not recognized. The computer does not seem to know that a dock has been plugged in. Indeed, when I downloaded the firmware from the Dell website and tried to install it, I got an error message from the Update Utility telling me that ""No Dell Dock Attached.""

&#x200B;

I have tried unplugging everything, plugging things in one at a time, restarting the computer, verifying the BIOS accepts Thunderbolt devices...at this point, I am thinking that I misunderstood the dock compatibility with this machine *or* either my Thunderbolt port is broken or the dock itself is faulty.

&#x200B;

Any guidance would be much appreciated.

&#x200B;

EDIT: added Help tag.

EDIT: I should add that I am drawing power from the dock when the Thunderbolt cable is connected."
Dell Optiplex 7400 All in one resolution/pixelation issue
"Has anyone else noticed a resolution/pixelation issue in the new 7400 and 5400 AIOs from Dell?  Weâ€™ve been ordering the newest AIO models for the last several years and never had a problem until a recent batch of 25 or so PCs that shipped after mid-late October. Itâ€™s very obvious up close, especially when compared to an older model AIO like the 5490 or 7490. It may not be as easy to see in pictures."
Dell update vs support assist?
Latitude 7290 - no FHD options?
"So, Dell's website (https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-uk/latitude-12-7290-laptop/latitude_7290_om/technical-specifications?guid=guid-91dfb1bd-b6d4-494b-80b5-afc153100aaf&lang=en-us) seems to be pretty clear about it, but are there really no FHD options for 7290? Has anyone seen those? 

I'm surprised since 7280 does have 1080p panels, so it's kind of weird to see lack of them in specsheet for the newer model."

I didn't know customer service could be this bad! They even lied to me.
"**TLDR:** Dell wouldn't fix my PC for years because their diagnostic program was useless and couldn't read the hardware fault until this year. The initial tech even saw it via remoting in. They now refuse to acknowledge my request to extend warranty. They will not replace my never working properly GPU with a new or equivalent. They sent me a dysfunctional GPU and left the previous owners name in the box. The PC has never functioned correctly. The tech support people sent me through a 10-6pm loop of people with fake escalations. They then refused to do an RMA. Then said they would only send a tech to install it. Then lied and stated that refurbished means brand new but tested. Now they are not acknowledging the return as of yet as they are trying to waste as much time on the remainder of my warranty. **Screenshots and details below. I am an idiot. This is my fault for not returning right away. Lets get that out of the way LOL!!!**

First off, this is going to be a little long. I've included some screenshots of my recent chats with Dell towards the end. This is where they lie to be about what refurbished means. They tried to tell me that refurbished is a new product, but its just been opened for testing lol!

In 2018 I decided to gift my Alienware Laptop to my brother in law and purchase an Alienware R8. On paper it was pretty awesome. Not top of the line but damn good. It was equipped with an 8086k and a 2080 GPU. I also got the basic warranty for 4 years. At the time I figured the only loss was an on-site technician (no biggie at all) and waiting in queue longer. Or so I thought. I usually built my own PC's prior to this. But I got a great deal at the time and the wife wanted to pitch in as a gift for Christmas. The PC arrived in January 2019. Boy was I excited! I opened it up, got it all set up and turned it on. I immediately started having issues.

Upon boot Windows was having issues. It was prone to random BSOD. Before calling Dell I thought I would try and tackle it myself. I made sure everything was seated properly within the computer and then started on the software end. I reinstalled windows and all the drivers MANY times. I even tried older and newer drivers. I used the Support Assist software you can launch upon boot to test my hardware too. Everything was showing up fine. After a few days of trying to get this working I called tech support.

A really nice guy got on the phone with me and remoted in. He was able to witness a BSOD. We also noted that videos would stall my PC and sometimes crash it. There were other oddities as well. As per usual we had to go through everything I had already done prior to this. I was expecting it. No big deal. It sucks. But it is what it is. In the end this tech determined that I had a bad disc image. Using a built in tool we re-downloaded it all from their servers and did a fresh boot. There were fewer BSOD's and he didn't check videos even though I requested it. He said the benchmark program he was using and HWinfo was sufficient. Sigh. All tests showed my system had no issue. Fast forward a day or two and I am speaking to him again. We uninstall and reinstall stuff. I've lost so many hours on this PC at this time. So I mention that I want to return it. He talks me out of it and the wife said I should wait too. He said he guarantees he can fix it as its a software issue. Well, this goes on for some time. Eventually the errors are a little less frequent. And then for a day or two with minimal usage they were gone. So he closed the case. Im now out of my return window and the issues are back. Not as bad, but still multiple times a day.

I speak to a few people over the phone and NONE are willing to do anything for me. They all state that since the tests that both I and the rep have done show there are no hardware faults, the most they can do is what I have already done....

So I gave up. I downclocked some and ramped up the fans. It seemed to help a bit. It was annoying. I used it, but very little over the next couple years. I felt defeated. Every time I called it was the same thing. No errors... cant help. Go away.

So now its October 2022. I have barely used the computer in a year. I hated it. I used a work laptop from Lenovo. Not as powerful but it was reliable. Then I get very ill (still am). I end up on sickness leave (still am). So I start using the PC again. Mostly for watching movies and streaming. Well, all the issues are still here. Then on December 6th I get an email to extend the warranty. I'm like, you know what? Maybe I will. I will try contacting them again and I will put in the request to extend my warranty and see if maybe they can help me out this time.

&#x200B;

[Email received on Dec 6th, 2022 at 10:03am](https://preview.redd.it/1rzb2k5jkw5a1.png?width=909&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e6070913b11829339f3a808bf964d2319828500b)

So I fill out the request a quote and haven't heard back to this day December the 14th. My wife also filled it out. We have filled out the form a combined 6 times and no one will contact us. In the conversations below I brought this up several times and **the Dell representatives ignored it each and every time.**

On December 6th I decided to contact Dell through chat to receive some help. I get a very dull and to the point representative named Brandon from Dell Tech Support. I tell him my problems and he wants to do what I already tried for years. Uninstall and reinstall my drivers. Well we do. We update the BIOS, Chipset drivers, and GPU drivers. No biggie. I told him that drivers aren't going to suddenly fix an issue that I had been experiencing all these years and we need to look at it a different way. So he has me run some tests in the menu I am familiar with that you can access upon boot. No issues. Problem is still there though. After a couple days of back and forth he has me install Dell Support Assist for windows. I run it, and BAM. Finally something that shows my GPU has an error.

&#x200B;

[Finally some proof! ](https://preview.redd.it/x3aaxvkmlw5a1.png?width=591&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=95a8a34a033b5da6d20f617b3af75c163c70d90a)

I asked him to look at the history of my calls to see that this is an ongoing issue that I have had since the start. My argument was that I have never had a working card. This PC has only ever had problems. He says he agrees I need a new GPU. Wonderful! He puts in a dispatch and a part arrives after the weekend on December 12th. I got it really early. I installed in the afternoon. Upon opening the package the card looked VERY used. Heck, before I even got it out of its packet the card was really squeaky and flexing. I have this on video. I told my wife, whatever. If it works I will continue using it. The previous owner was a lady named Elizabeth. The tech company ""Ivy"" had left her details in there. Sigh. So anyway, the card is now installed. I boot up... there is a bearing issue with the fan. Ok.... I know tech support is going to make an issue of this so I complete boot up and run the tests. It passes every test. No heating issues. Nadda. So I do one other test. I load up Cyberpunk and some other games. HOLY CRAP THIS CARD SUCKS! It revs up to 100, then down to 0. Then to 100, then down to 0. Its so loud! I honestly did not know a GPU fan could make this much noise. It was louder than my speakers. So I call tech support and offer to have him call to hear, or I can send a video. Brandon asks me to install the most recently released drivers to try and fix the hardware issue. Sigh... so I do. We all know that won't fix the issue. It didn't. I take the card out, put my old one in and the fan ramping up issue is gone. It also no longer has the fan bearing noise. I sent the card back yesterday. It arrived this morning. I've already contacted Dell about it. No response.

While this was going on yesterday I thought I would try another avenue as recommended by another user here on Reddit. I contacted Dell on Twitter (Dell Cares Pro). I was very kind to each rep. The first was Suranjana, they escalate me to a supervisor named Kughalu. They put me through to another supervisor named **Ashwin. I was kind to each and everyone. But Ashwin tested me... he lied to me and I got a bit short without being totally rude IMO.** This clown told me that **refurbished means brand new**, but tested. I was explaining how I wanted a new 2080, or equivalent because I didn't want to go through what I read online. And as this was a documented long-term problem, I never got the new, functioning card I purchased. I admit I tried to play a bit of the pity party too. I am ill. It sucks. I don't want to waste all my time trying GPU's and I share this. This is when he tells me that the GPU's are new. Not just once either!!! He offers to send a tech to install it for me. I don't want someone in my home. I temporarily have an incredibly low immune system due to my drugs and treatments. And come on... this system doesn't even use screws!!!! I want to make this clear. **I have not once asked for an upgrade.** NOT ONCE. Just equivalent. Even if that meant a lower tier 3000 series. But a brand new 2080, or mostly new (guaranteed) would have been fine.

&#x200B;

So yeah. He tells me they are not used GPU's as you can see. I then said no to the tech service. I said I will just go ahead and keep getting bad parts until a good one arrives. I won't be buying Dell again. They have wasted SO many of my days and hours its insane. Heck, even this chat had started at 10:25 am. I had also given them MANY chances to just leave me alone. But they kept ""escalating"" LOL!!!. I was defeated. He responds with this:

I argued against this. I said that refurbished is used. I was upset that they were seemingly now not going to allow me to RMA my card. I admitted I was angry.

&#x200B;

I then take a break. I respond later with ""I'm sure"".

A new, nameless rep enters the chat.

This person does not argue that the parts are new at least. This one says the refurbished parts are inspected before being sent out. Bullpoop!!! I was straight up. I have nothing going on. So I keep responding. You've lost me as a customer. There is no happy resolution. I bought a new working video card and never received it. I received a PC that has so many issues and was a dummy and didn't return it on time. **THIS IS ON ME!!!! I KNOW THIS!!!! DON'T BE LIKE THIS IDIOT! AVOID DELL OR RETURN RIGHT AWAY IF YOU CAN! I SUCK! I MESSED UP!!!!** This is my 6th computer from Dell that I purchased for myself in 13 years. Hell, I even bought their old PDA's. I had the one with the 3d processor (Dell Axim x51V). My parents bought me other laptops from them. My first one that I personally bought was the Dell Studio 17 in green. Damn that thing was awesome! I loved the texture. It was like this soft rubbery one. After that I bought 4 Alienware laptops. No issues with any except a HDD fault on the last. Which I fixed myself because I didn't care and was going to replace the drive anyway. In total I have owned about 10 Dell computers. A few monitors (they used to be so awesome), and some accessories. I even had the Dell Streak before huge phones were popular! In fact, I still have it and it STILL works.

So Dell.... BITE ME! You won't get my business ever again. And you can be sure as heck that I will share my experiences with anyone and everyone. I was willing to let it all be until your reps starting to lie to me. But no, you kept escalating and telling me you'll have an resolution. You kept telling me to talk to another rep. You kept telling me that I was moved to a higher priority when all you did was move me to another rep that said the same things. I would have got over it had you not done this several times in a row. You wasted my time on repairs, you wasted my money, and you insulted me in chat. DONE!"
Dell Price Match: Excuses or incomparability. i7-1250U & i7-1255
"So this Â£&[#;Â£>>Ã—*Â£&>@*&#>#*;#&: Dell customer service chat seems really despicable and majorly wasted my time.

Within i7, 16gb, 256gb, graphics, touch parameters, I searched on lenovo and hp and submitted the price match.

But this sneaky staff found a totally uncomparable cheaper laptop that was completely outside the parameters: i3/i5, 12gb, 128/256gb, non-touch and tried to match it to that saying it was 'comparable' and that identical i7/16/256/graphics/touch models filtered from the parameters weren't. So I pointed it out.

Dell:

""the HP machine screen shot you have shared is equivalent to the Inspiron 15 machine which I have provided the link to you as well

Dell machine link:
https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/inspiron-15-laptop/spd/inspiron-15-3511-laptop/nn3511eyxuh

We have a better deal on this configuration identical to the machine you are checking from HP

 

Hp machine link:
https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-laptop-15-dy5097nr""

But the response by Hariharam Balasubramanian said it was not 'the same' because the Dell was made of aluminium. (the hp and lenovo were made of metal too, but it was not even written on the page and he does not even know if hp/ lenovo was not aluminium).

Then he goes on to say the Dell model is an i7-1250u (cheaper) while the other two were i7-1255 (upgrade) so he will not price match. There is also a i7-1260 which I did not tey to price match. Lenovo, HP AND Dell all do not even distinguish within i7 variations on any header or category or sub-filter. Is this that big a difference for it to be non-comparable?

Dell's was also smaller at 13"" than one so submitted a re-price match for ""identical"" specs: 15"" vs. 15"". The other was identical at 13"" vs. 13"". But 

Finally, this made it damning proof that the Dell guy was weaseling out of it. Despicable. He changed the parameters. It was 256gb, but he argued there were 512gb options (yea, and all comp stores have 1tb, 2tb too). A non-issue.

I don't think they're doing price matching in gd faith. Halfway through it seemed sus. As though they weren't trying to price match but to just give a bunch of excuses.

Needless to sayï¼Œno one's believing an i7/16/256/graphics/touch is incomparable to another i7/16/256/graphics/touch and somehow comparable to a cheap Dell recommended i3 or i5/12/128/ non-touch model. The only thing that is 'similar' is that it is cheaper than the hp/lenovo i7s.

People should really hold them to account for this degree of despicable behavior. If Dell is too cheap to actually execute the guarantee, then stop doing such sneaky stuff. Consumers should also make a table of comparables so they can't twist with made up or unknown things."
R720XD Perc 710 mini with Western Digital drives
"I recently acquired two R720XD systems along with a few MD1200s. The machines have  PERC H710P mini controllers for the internal drives and the 810 for the MD1200s. As they were in production for multiple years without issue, being diligent I updated all the firmware for the hardware and the drives. After doing that all the western digital drives fail when the controller queries them. If I go into the bios controller setup I can reseat the drives and they appear to be functional with no errors. When I reboot the system they all go to failed state. I have other drives from Seagate, HST, Toshiba and none of those have issues, only the WD drives.

I'd love to solve this problem as I have about 36 or more 3TB drives that are paperweights if I can't get them to work.

I used my google foo and found some references to this problem, I've added the link to the most descriptive post related to this problem but it still shows unresolved.

Specs or user feedback regarding touch screens on Dell Optiplex AIO systems
"So Dell specs are a bit brief regarding touch screen specs on their Optiplex AIO systems.  These systems have optional touch screens with the only spec listed is ""touch"".  Are they glossy, glass screens?  It seems so because the touch versions weigh slightly more than non touch.  Are they capacitive 10 point multi touch?  Do they have pen support?

I have a dell Latitude 5290 2 in 1 tablet and I love the touch screen on it.  Are the optiplex models similar?  Is the touch responsiveness comparable to a modern android / apple tablet or phone?

The models I'm looking at are the Optiplex 3260, 3280, 5260.  Basically any 21.5"" model.  Any users with hands on (literally) experience who could share their experience or folks with more detailed specs than what dell offers (like the part number and specs for replacement screens) would be much appreciated!"

Dell Power Settings - Windows 11H2
"Alright so just to check (any Dell Laptop really but mainly XPS and Precision question)

Under Control Panel - Power Options - are people using Balanced or if they still have it the custom Dell power plan?

I've noticed the Dell plan rarely puts the laptop to sleep, seems to just shut it down?

Then under the new Settings app, under System - Power & Battery - there's three more options under Power Mode - Best Power Efficiency, Balanced and Best Performance.

I'm guessing there are differences between Power Plans and Power Modes but the whole thing is just really badly designed and documented by MS & Dell.

Anyone with any further info that can share what I should have the device on in the Control Panel and then I'm guessing the other modes in the new Settings app are much more dynamic and the ones to currently use whereas the plans are set and forget?   


Just setting the right one!"
Windows 10 32-bit on new(ish) Dell notebook
"I have an old (but necessary) 16-bit application that needs to run on a modern 64-bit OS.  I've successfully used an Oracle Virtualbox VM for quite a while and am thinking about trying a Hyper-V VM as well.

What I really like to do is install Windows 10 32-bit on a new(ish)  Dell notebook and not have to fool with a VM at all.  Rather not have 2 operating systems to patch, etc.  This would be a single app machine and doesn't need to do anything else.  Anybody know of the newest Dell notebook that still supports a 32-bit OS?  I've asked our Dell sales rep but not getting much back.

Thanks."
dell latitude disk led indicator
"Hi  
I was wondering if post led in 5480/5490 latitudes, and same generation higher models could be accessed using windows software to make it work as disk indicator?  

Of course this might not make sense having ssd disks on board, but still when doing lotsa data writes it would be nice to know about it.  
I'm currently using a software led indicators, but they got many cons.  

I've just had a second approach to search through webz, looking if somebody had a similar ""need"" and got a solution, but my search came again to nothing.   

I remember that I've came across solutions utilising external lcd displays, but that's not the case.   

Maybe somebody encountered a solution?"
Dell booting issue on Latitude 5420
How do I adjust the RBG/CYMK on my laptop?
"Hi all. I just bought my first Dell this weekend (the G15 Gaming Laptop) and so far so good. My one complaint is that the screen appearance is very ""yellow."" I don't have the ""night light"" toggled, it is the normal display version, but all the colors are still very warm.  Is there a way to open a panel to adjust the CYMK/RBG colors? The monitor display definitely needs a shift into more blue-tones.  I googled, but all I can find are ways to change the colors of various icons, and how to toggle on/off the ""night light"" mode.

Thanks in advance!"

Extensive Delays with Dell On-Site Servicing - is this Normal?
"Have an XPS15 7590 thatâ€™s been facing random and frequent shutdowns as a result of a failing motherboard. Itâ€™s still covered by warranties so Iâ€™m able to receive next business day support. 

Sent a request in on December 12th, was told it would likely take 2-3 business days by the support agent, found out today that the parts will not be shipped out until December 22nd, meaning I likely wonâ€™t receive service until 2023 (due to both the holidays and a family vacation).

I know that part and labour shortages have been a recurring issue for many industries since the start of the pandemic, but this defeats the purpose of â€œnext business dayâ€ support. Has anyone else had experiences like this with Dell support?"
Dell 7480/7490 running Linux and two external monitors
"Hello Dell family,

Long time Dell user, time has come to change my E7450 and I've been reading all morning but couldn't find the information I've been looking for. I'm on the fence between a used Latitude 7480 and 7490 and wanted to check if anyone can help. 

As the title says I will be running linux connected to two P2720 (2560x1440) monitors. So my question is would this work with 7480/7490 out of the box or do I need a docking station ? I'm tempted to go with 7480 as it has bigger battery and better cooling but 7490 has newer generation CPU and perhaps better connectivity in terms of external graphics. I won't be running anything fancy on the laptop and i5 should be enough. I'm afraid that if I go with i7 the fan will go on most of time and keyboard will get hot. Will appreciate if there are any users in same situation who can share their exprience. 

Thanks in advance!"
Dell XPS 15 does not recognize original power supply
"I have a Dell XPS and when I plug in the original power supply it says that the power supply has not been recognized and that I should please use a Dell power supply with at least 130 watts. My boss, who has the same laptop, had the same problem a while back. Should I buy the original Dell power supply again or should I buy a USB C power supply with at least 130 watts and then charge the laptop via USB C?"

Dell Partner - Bad Mobo - Replacement Hoops to Jump Through ðŸ¤¦ðŸ»â€â™‚ï¸
"Full transparency. I've been in the IT industry for 30+ years. I know bad hardware and how to troubleshoot. It's part of my daily thing.

Long story short. Purchased 5 new Dell 3080 MFF PCs from a large legit distributor. All deal registrations must go through this supplier.

1st one out of the box to configure it and it freezes and reboots every 4 minutes and 51 seconds like clock work. Swapped out ram, m.2, and cpu. Same issue.

Dell Partner portal doesn't have any special support from what I can tell and they throw you into the general queue. Twice on chat the agents dismissed a hardware issue. They had me run the basic hardware test which passes obviously because it's only 3 minutes long.

My rep stated to call a specific number and go through the troubleshooting again.

The same bullshit questions were asked. Literally a copy and paste from their script. Questions that made no sense to what I was explaining. I wasn't able to keep windows running long enough to check anything.

I can guarantee there's a bad component on the motherboard that's causing this. The agents don't listen to what you say and follow their stupid script to a Tee.

I worked in a large well known telecom company for a number of years. We needed full blown prior networking knowledge before we were even trained on their proprietary technology. Coupled together we were extremely well versed in find issues and fixing them in record time.

Wtf ever happened to agents that had prior knowledge of how a computer works, etc. There's no number to call and complain, the agent language barrier is another issue, the fact the they seem to hire anyone is bad for business because these agent don't give two shits what you say. I explained my issue twice. Once when the call started and once again when advanced ops got involved.

After two failed chats, two 30+ minute calls (one of which the agent had an attitude) in which both calls dropped right as they asked for my address (ironically), I finally got back with the previous agent and 15 minutes of silence on the line later, they finally sent out a replacement motherboard.

Seriously, is this how they treat partners? Jeez I can only imagine how badly they treat a regular customer."
I HATE My Dell G3 Laptop
"I got this laptop as an upgrade from my last (HP) and for the last 6-9 months has really made me regret leaving my HP laptop. I purchased a Dell G3 15 3500 in Sept 2020. I moved from Texas to Louisiana -- mainly relative to story bc I hadn't had any issues until moving here...and though I'm not sure if that has anything to do with the reasons why I'm having so many problems...I'm about ready to chunk this thing at the wall (figuratively).

&#x200B;

I saw on a few different websites about people having the charging issues I've come across and some of them have resolutions that others have tried and haven't worked. I don't know what to do with it to fix the issues. I recently went to Best Buy to see if there was something or info they could give me. They advised me to bring it to a local tech who specializes with these kind of issues (plugged in, not charging). I got it back and the rep said it was the ac adapters. (bc I've purchased one replacement other than the original provided in box. \[130W\]). I recently (today) bought another universal charger (180W from Best Buy). I swear I'm literally about to say F\*ck it and buy another laptop and trade this in or something. 

&#x200B;

Can anyone help me??

&#x200B;

\--note-- I am not super techie when it comes to pcs/laptops.

Thanks for anyone who may be able or willing to help/offer their experiences."

Is the WD19S 180W docking station supposed to work with Precision 3571?
"Hi there!

I got an old XPS15 9560, and my company gave me a Precision 3571 to work remotely 2 days a week.

I searched for a docking station to be able to quickly swap the two laptops at my home desk, including the power.

The [official docking station compatibility matrix](https://www.delltechnologies.com/asset/en-us/products/electronics-and-accessories/technical-support/dell_docking_compatibility_guide.pdf) states the WD19S works with the Precision 3571, and by searching a little on the web I found that it also works with the XPS, so I bought a refurbished one for 180â‚¬.

The XPS correctly detects it, and with Fedora I was able to update the firmware in no time; but when I try to connect it to the Precision, the docking station stays off. I tried with Ubuntu, windows and even a colleague's 3571 to no avail.

I borrowed a WD19TBS from IT and it works; I also tried to use the TBS cable with my S, and it starts working, which brings me to the question: Is the WD19S really compatible with the Precision 3571?

If so, do you know any trick to make it work (already tried the troubleshooting page, nothing works)?

If not, why the hell is stated as supported on the official compatibility list???"
Dell optiplex 7000 not booting with new Ram

"Keyboard replacement service question (Dell XPS-13, 7390)"
"Hi,  


Do you guys know, does the replacement for a keyboard of Dell XPS-13, 7390, 2-in-1 require any sort of ""pressing in"" or anything more advanced than simply taking all the bones and meat out and simply putting the new keyboard in?

Why I am asking this:

Since my keyboard got multiple keys stuck, one lost, I decided to go for a replacement at a local IT service place (not Dell authorized).

Retrospectively it was a bad decision - it's my main freelancing tool and it is now 2 days since I don't have it, frustration levels are skyrocketing and my clients are pining me.   
The service place was though a rather suspicious one, the price for keyboard was rather above normal, but well, they seemed to have it faster than other places I could find. Now the guy who works there instantly said it will take around 1 full day for a replacement, since the keyboard replacement for this laptop involves ""pressing in"" the keyboard, which takes time. I waited for the keyboard to arrive, and finally brought my laptop there. It all went a bit south afterwards - turns out, the keyboard they have is wrong (though I sent my service tag beforehand) but they don't want to give me my laptop back, because it is all taken apart. They wanted me to wait for a new one, but I insisted they put the old one back and give me my laptop.   


Hopefully, I am getting it back in one piece tomorrow. But it still bothers me - was it all scam, including that ""pressing in"" part?  Just want to understand was it really just bad luck or should I stay away from that place. Thanks!"
Dell is asking me to send broken parts back after I purchased replacement parts
"My laptop screen broke, I contacted Dell support to purchase a new replacement screen as it was out of warranty. I received the new screen, installed it, and disposed of the old broken screen. A few weeks later I received an email with a mail label asking me to return the old broken screen, I contacted Dell support again to make sure it wasn't a mistake since the replacement screen was purchased at full price. They insisted I had to send back the old screen and could not explain why.... honestly I don't care why! The old screen is my property and I can do whatever the heck I want to do with it, they have no right to ask me to send it back! 

Has anybody else experienced the same with Dell?

New Windows 10 Laptop has multiple driver issues [X-Post from r/WindowsHelp]
"[Full version of OS is Windows 10 Pro Version 21h2, 19044.2251. Hardware is a Dell Vostro 5410 with an Intel Core i5-11300H]

I got a new Dell laptop a few months back with an SSD that runs Windows 10. 90% of the time it works great, but there are a few things that are a major pain to deal with:

* Every so often it'll crash to bluescreen. Since I started keeping track of crashes, I've had at least sixteen with various error codes (4 System-service-exception codes, 3 critical_process_died, 2 pfn_list_corrupt, 2 driver_power_state_failure, and 1 each of page_fault_in _nonpaged_Area, DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL, bad_pool_header, System_Thread_Exception_Not_Handled, and Invalid_Work_Queue_Item)
* For some reason, my headset only works the first time I plug it into the headphone jack. After that, the system won't recognize it or offer it as an option in the sound menu unless I restart the computer.
* This may be unrelated, but I have an external HDD I use for backup and storage that refuses to eject. When I try to circumvent that by powering the PC off, it prevents it from shutting down and gets stuck on the shutdown screen.

I find that it tends to behave so long as I shut it completely off every 2-3 days, and so long as I don't use the hibernation feature often (Instead fully powering it down). Sleep doesn't work, but I think that's how the PC was configured, not a driver error.
I can't be certain, but the only thing I can remember doing before it gave me this trouble was restoring it to factory settings when I forgot the password. Aside from that, I haven't installed any sketchy software, changed registry keys, etc., so I'm not sure what the issue could be.

Any advice is greatly appreciated!"
Dell Vostro 5502 keyboard issues
"The laptop mentioned started to have problems with the keyboard. The problems started with key 2 from numpad: when pressed it doesn't show and yes, the NumLock was turned on then the same problem appeared to 5; 8 and * keys. A few days ago the same problem appeared to another keys, like z; c; v; m; . ; right shift; Windows and today: enter. 

Has anyone something similar? And if yes, what was the cause? 

To mention: this laptop is under warranty

Edit: after a good 10 - 20 minutes , the keys mentioned starts to work as nothing happened."

Wake from sleep when lid is opened
"Hi all, I've bought a pretty kitted out Dell Precision 7750 and have been happy with it overall.

However, it has one annoying feature - it wakes from sleep (not off or hibernation) when the lid is opened. This means it sometimes turns on while I'm commuting, cooking itself inside my laptop bag.

According to the buyer, the old CPU (i5-6500) works, but ""when I install the CPU the start button light will flash orange for a breif second then all the fans will stop. Keep in mind everything turns on for half a second.""

I am asking for them to try it with just the CPU and 1 stick of RAM, but is this CPU is even compatible with the 7040 SFF mobo?

Laptop power jack gets loose every year and I can't charge
"Basically the title - 

I bought my laptop from Dell in Dec 2016. Since around 2018, every year around the 1 year mark my charger jack gets loose and needs to be replaced and repaired. I use my laptop almost daily so finding time to be without it for the repair is hard. The last place I had it repaired gave me a 1-year warranty on the repair so the next year they repaired it for free. These places never believe me when I say what the issue is so they delay in ordering the parts they need. 

I know the jack is attached to the motherboard and it would be hard to repair myself. Is there any way to keep this from being a yearly occurnace? Anything to tell the repair people?  My laptop works great otherwise and these repairs are incovnient."

Thoughts on XPS 600 and 700 Series Towers
"I am considering a purchase of a Dell XPS 600 or 700 series system and looking for thoughts and suggestions. The OS will end up being XP or 7 and the primary use will be playing games appropriate of the XP or 7 era. Likely nothing too stressful though. I enjoy upgrading systems I purchase so I'll likely look to max out the processor and memory at the very least. I HATE loud systems so I will pay a small premium for a quiet system. 

I see plenty of 630i systems for sale and also have a line on a beautiful black 720 H2C system. 730s, are unobtanium at sub-$700 prices. I'm not sure of the implications of BTX vs ATX but the 600s and 730 all use ATX motherboards whereas the 720 is BTX.

With all of this in mind, what're your thoughts and suggestions? Does one system satisfy my needs better? Which system is likely to be quieter? Will cooling upgrades like fans be more difficult in the BTX vs ATX? Will having a BTX motherboard get in the way of upgrades?

TIA"

Dell Docking Station DW19C to desktop
"How would I go about plugging in a dual USB-C Dell DW19 docking station for laptops to my desktop? It only has USB ports. 

Is there a converter or adapter I can use? 

So right now, there's two screens plugged in the docking stations as outputs. I'm wondering if the USBC inputs can come from a desktop computer's USB 3.0 slots with some kind of adapter.

I have to switch between my laptop and desktop for work, but want to keep the screens / accessories plugged in the same spot.

Thanks folks!"
Dell support will not fix BSOD's on computer <1year old - beware
"Just had the worst experience with Dell.

My DELL XPS purchased less than a year ago has been BSOD'ing randomly since I purchased it; an issue that was intermittent at first but has now become a daily event.

Three support tickets later, Dell insists that the issue is software.

After the 2nd ticket I performed a full system refresh and now only have Dell Software - the problem persists. After opening the 3rd ticket, Dell support insists this is a software issue that I have to pay premium support to fix.

Dell's strategy is to bundle broken software, then have customers pay extra to fix it.

They then advertised the support rate at $99 - but when I arrive at the website they want to charge $129.

CAVEAT EMPTOR - Buyer beware. There are lots of computing brands out there that stand behind their products. Dell doesn't appear to be one of them

&#x200B;

**And a BSOD is a driver/hardware problem -** **~~NOT a software problem~~** **can be software OR hardware (edit).  I will never purchase again from this company! (still stand by this!)**

G5 gaming laptop poor performance and heating problems
"I own this laptop for 2 years now. It always worked well. It handled VR easily, had good performance etc. 

Until the last few months. I have some issues with it now:

\- Some of the laptop's cores are always at 100 Â° C after about half an hour of gaming, even with a cooling pad.

\- It has poor performance after some time. Starting around 70-80 fps, dropping to 35-45 fps. On games like Arma 3 i've had drops to 6-10 fps.

The fps drops always happen when it overheats. It definitely has something to do with thermals. I have done this to try to fix it:

\-Bought a cooling pad, as i said before.

\-Reapplied thermal paste

\-Replaced fans

\-Disabling all open apps when gaming

\-Tweaked the fan usage in Alienware so they are always running at the highest possible setting.

Is this a common issue?  And how do i fix it?  I haven't done any overclocking in fear of breaking something.

Here are my specs:
-RTX 2060
-Intel Core i7 9th gen
-16 gb RAM

Totally unhappy with my XPS 13 Plus
"I used a XPS 13 intensively for 3 years and got myself an upgrade in the Form of the new XPS 13 Plus. I really liked the design and still do, but that integrated TouchPad is awful. There is absolutely no feedback at all and instead of clicking I'm constantly dragging items around instead of moving the pointer. I got myself an extra mouse just to be able to work when I'm away from my desk. So... Did I got a Monday morning laptop or is this a more wide spread problem?"

Inspiron 7577 Left Fan Noise
"Problem: The left fan was making a grinding noise and the noise would change if I moved the laptop and even if I flipped it upside down.

I tried a solution on a 7577 and we will see how it goes. I took apart my computer and replaced both fans (cost is about $40 on Amazon and takes about 2 weeks to get here from China). Even after the fan replacement I still had the noise.

I noticed that the fan blades were rubbing and had created a groove in the thin piece of sheet metal that the fan is mounted on.

https://preview.redd.it/uuiki10lhi6a1.jpg?width=1324&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c281c4649b4bf48af9640cdabc237b7323dc8ddf

This tells me that there is not enough space between the fan and the piece of sheet metal. I took a hot glue gun and added a bead of glue on top of the fan housing where it would touch the metal sheet (thus providing extra room for the fan blades). I let the glue dry and installed the fan. The result is a quite computer! I wish I had tried this years ago!!! That noise was miserable!!!! 

Is this a manufacturers defect?

Here is what I do not know and would caution doing this fix. I do know know if the metal plate is going to get hot enough to re-melt the hot glue gun glue. If I get the noise back, this will most likely be the cause.

Can somebody with a 3d printer make a gasket like object that will fit between the fan housing and the metal sheet the fan mounts on?"
Does anybody know how to fix this? It is a school computer but I never had this issue.

Dell XPS 9520 - The worst laptop I have ever owned
"**Context**

On the heels of a dying gaming laptop, and after mulling it over for a year, I decided to bite the bullet back in July and purchase a Dell XPS 9520 (15 inch, 32GB RAM, Nvidia RTX 3050 Ti), both for regular home use, as well as professional use (as I work almost exclusively from home).

I'm a software developer who neededed the extra RAM for work.

Purchasing this laptop is one of the worst decisions I have ever made.

Whilst it's quite a solid piece of hardware with nice build quality, the driver support is just absolutely awful. I have had so many small nagging issues so frequently that it has marred my entire experience with this laptop from day 1. The laptop came with Windows 11, which I suspect is responsible (alongside Dell's horrible drivers) for at least some of the issues I experience.

*TLDR* \- Anyone looking to buy this laptop who intends to use AUX audio output should be very, very wary.

**Audio**

The primary problem I've had with this laptop is the audio. I have had so many persistent and disruptive issues with it that I'm now at a lose about what to do with this laptop.

The audio seems to lean off a horrible piece of bloatware called ""MaxxAudioPro"" which is annoying, obnoxious, and by default applies unwanted ""enhancement"" effects to the output. Unfortunately, without MaxxAudioPro, the laptop can't recognize when headphones have been plugged in.

For many months I experienced a consistent issue whereby everytime I connected a USB audio output source (a small DAC for music), the laptop would refuse to output audio via speakers or AUX until I restarted. Even after disconnecting the DAC, I'd be unable to get audio through another output source without a restart. Some research led me to remove the Realtek HD Audio driver and instead use Microsoft's default HD audio drivers to fix this issue.

But since then I've experienced similar random occasional instances of being unable to get audio via earphones without a restart, or being unable to get speaker audio after connecting/disconnecting earphones without a restart, or just flat out losing audio altogether and needing a restart. These happen intermittently and quite frequently, forcing me to restart numerous times throughout any given week, and often interrupting work calls.

Last week, AUX audio output stopped working altogether, prompting me to contact Dell support. After following their instructions and installing the latest Windows update and audio drivers from Dell's website, the speaker audio also stopped working.

I since discovered that I had to set the ""Audio Enhancements"" setting in Windows sound settings to ""Default Effects"" to regain audio. Switching ""enhancements"" off results in no audio at all.

However, since the Dell support incident, the audio quality out of the laptop has been utterly abysmal. Muffled, distorted and with a noticeable echo effect. I've been completely unable to fix this issue, despite numerous attempts.

I've gone through several rounds of uninstalling/reinstalling all the audio drivers and software from Dell's website, and attempted other audio drivers from Realtek/Intel, with varying results:

* Lost audio completely at one stage. Interestingly the Windows startup sounds still worked.
* Got audio back without forced ""enhancement effects"" but with almost inaudibly low max volume.
* Fixed audio quality for AUX port, but speakers only outputted one volume (max volume) regardless of what the volume meter was set to. AUX volume selection worked fine.

After more uninstalls/reinstalls of the Dell driver, I'm now back where I was after Dell support's ""help"", with clearly malfunctioning and distorted audio quality coming from all output sources, and no audio at all if I switch ""Auidio Enhancements"" off.

A brief search on these issues has turned up numerous results (for each), ranging from years old to recent. It seems I'm not alone in encountering persistent issues with Dell's audio drivers, and not alone in my revulsion of MaxxAudioPro, which these laptops are shackled to.

I'm baffled that for nearly $4000 AUD, I've received a product that can't functionally provide something as basic as audio. I don't know why Dell, after so many years of community issues, can't seem to produce reliable audio drivers.

These issues have driven me nearly insane, and constantly interrupt me on a daily basis during work calls and meetings.

**Other Issues**

Below I will list, in no particular order, and by no means exhaustively, a smattering of the menagerie of other problems I have had with this laptop:

* When I wake the laptop from sleep and it's connected to an external display, both displays will experience substantial lag. The solution is to unplug the external display, unplug the charger, and plug both back in. This happens frequently (but not always).
* Occasionally the laptop won't charge when the charger and an external display are plugged in. The solution is again....unplug both, reconnect the charger, then the external display.
* Dell's power management software is broken. The ""Always AC"" mode is supposed to stop charging at 80% to preserve battery life. It doesn't. I had to set a custom 50% - 80% setting, which works chaotically. The laptop randomly starts/stops charging anywhere in that range, and sometimes just hovers at a random value (55%, 70%, 75% etc.). It's completely unreliable and requires babysitting, which defeats the entire purpose of the utility even existing.
* In the 6 months I've owned this laptop, I've had **two forced BIOS** updates."

-------CPU ISSUES--------

i7-1165G7. It's a 11th gen i7, sounds pretty powerful right?

Intel specified it at 28W.
The chip scores 2800 on CPU-Z. (which is kinda meh, that's the speed of a desktop 9th gen i5, but it's understanble since its a low-power ultrabook solution.)

DELL capped it at 18.7W, so that made it the same speed of a 6th gen desktop i7.

Even with the cap, if i kept running the stress test it would eventually fall to 1100 points on CPU-Z stress, making it the same speed of a i3-4130. 

I managed to set the TDP limit to 28W using Project-SBC on GitHub, but it immediately jumps to 92â°C (PROCHOT) and falls from 28 to 18W within 20 seconds. Then it keeps going down and down.

-------NVIDIA GPU ISSUES--------

The MX330 is capped to a 67â°C limit, when it reaches that temp, it falls back to 139MHz which is the lowest 3D resolution for it. (Stock is 1700MHz)

So if i tried to play a game, it would immediately throttle from 20-30 fps to 2-5 fps.

Also, sometimes i would reach past that WITHOUT EVEN USING THE GPU, it averaged around 72â°C with only Discord open, because of the heat from the cpu going to the gpu. That means if i open a game it would run at 139MHz until it cools down (never)

I managed to increase the limit using Asus GPU Tweak II, i cranked it to the default 94â°C NVIDIA puts on it, when it reaches around 87â°C, the laptop all of a sudden shuts down, due to the VRM overheating. I could get it stable with 84â°C limit.

The CPU throttles even worse if i'm using the GPU with the 84â°C limit. The CPU throttles to 1100MHz sometimes. (Max frequency is 4700MHz) That makes it run with the same speed of a i5-4200U from 2013.


I could disable the MX330 and keep only the Iris Xe which surprisingly is BETTER than the MX330 in core speed.

But there is a problem, everything i talked here was with the laptop plugged in, when i unplug it, the CPU runs at the 28W limit i set under stress for some seconds and then falls to a 14W limit (not a hardware limitation, it's a Dell thing they put to limit usage on battery) (i couldn't manage to get around that one)

The problem is, the Iris shares the same TDP with the CPU core, so if both are being used, you get roughly 6W for the CPU and 6W for the Iris on battery, and the rest goes to CPU DRAM and other stuff.

And 6W for the CPU makes Windows extremely laggy and impossible to use.
So yeah, don't buy Dell ultrabooks with poor cooling and MX graphics cards."

"Just spent about 2 hours trying to buy a Dell UltraSharp 27 4K USB-C Hub Monitor - U2723QE on Dell.com.

Wanted to buy on Dell as Iâ€™ve really been trying to keep my dollars out of Jeff Bezosâ€™ pockets. 

Anyway I simply tried to buy the monitor for my wife for Christmas, I messaged retail support and asked if they price matched, they said yes and I provided him with the link the the actual Dell Store on amazon. It was 499$ there vs 625$ on Dell. He said ok please give me time to confirm the other posting, while he was supposedly working on my request he spent time telling me I should just buy the Dell.com version because everything I buy from Dell.com is built to order(itâ€™s a monitor, bull****) and will have all authentic Dell parts ( also bull****, youâ€™re telling me dell products on the Dell Store on Amazon are not authentic?) lol ok.

Anyway, after probably 45 minutes he tells me that he canâ€™t price match because even though they are listed through Dells Amazon store, itâ€™s fulfilled by a company that doesnâ€™t qualify for price matching. Fine, I guess.

Then I said well letâ€™s use Microcenter(surely they qualify for price matching) who was at 525$ so 25$ more than I should be paying but oh well. So after another long wait he says after research actually he canâ€™t price-match MicroCenter eitherâ€¦â€¦right. So they only pricematch if itâ€™s favorable I guess?

He asked me to wait as he had a good solution, so I wait, at this point itâ€™s been like 2 hoursâ€¦.2 hours, theyâ€™ve wasted two hours of both of our lives. I was committed at this point, just wanted to finish my holiday shopping. 

After the wait he came back and said he did some research, Newegg(whoâ€™s also been surprisingly non competitive lately) has one for $585 and he can price match it. Lol ok. 

Iâ€™m beyond frustrated over the whole interaction, I spend about 3-5k a year with dell because I have a technology problem, Iâ€™ll be taking my technology addiction elsewhere in the future. Iâ€™ll probably still buy Dell products as I think their XPS line is king of the mountain for non-gaming laptops, I will not be buying anything from Dell.com going forward. 

I guess I have to give Amazon my money but at least Iâ€™ll be giving them 125$ less."

Second question, regardless of what the M means, why is the u2720q about $200-300 more expensive?

I'm looking at getting a second monitor but I am picky about how things look on my desk and would like them to match. can't really find a used u2720qm but can find u2720q. I can see a new u2720q costs about 200-300 more than what I paid for the qm version."

It wonâ€™t turn on without being plugged in, wonâ€™t recognize the chargers (both my old one and the one I just bought) so it wonâ€™t charge. I ran system diagnostics it said the battery is excellent, and everything else was excellent as well. But the problem was with the charger but even the new ones I bought  wonâ€™t work. 
It was charging perfectly fine the day before with no issues but since then it has not charged past 0% and when I turn it on it has a black screen saying power type cannot be determined and the computer may not charge."

Lat 5490s hibernation when connected to power and ethernet issue
"Hey everyone. Need some direction. We use a bake box for our newly imaged machines. Previously, you simply plugged in ethernet and power and the machine stayed on to run updates, etc even with the lid closed. Our new 5430s still do this, but suddenly the freshly imaged 5490s go into hibernation/sleep when plugged in. 

How can we correct this where the 5490s stay on when closed without logging in to the machines? 

If any clarification is needed, please let me know. Thanks"

"Looking to reformat my sons PC.  I know how to reformat a PC, but Iâ€™m not sure how to ensure he is able to save the windows license he has from Dell.

Do any of the troubleshooting options within windows allow a factory reinstall of Windows that is not based on a dell image and will not include any dell bloatware?  I donâ€™t want to have to buy him a Windows license to do so.

UK Service Experiences
"Fellow Dell owners, 

I own a Dell XPS laptop that was purchased earlier this year and is in warranty, I recently have been having some issues with the trackpad, so created a ticket online, all good they will send an engineer with a new one. 

Engineer arrived, couldn't fit the part as one of the screws in the motherboard wouldn't come out and he didn't want to force it, no worries he would order the correct extra part then come back a week later (due to my availability). 

A week later, another technician turned up, and fitted the new part, but not the original part that was left with my, so replaced the motherboard I believe but not replaced the faulty trackpad part. My laptop has also not been put back together properly, and there are scratches which look like like it has been forced open with a screwdriver or similar, and the screws now protrude from the bottom. I wasn't in so engineer said this was complete and left. 

Now Dell are trying to send an engineer for a 3rd time, with a new original part to change it again... I work on customer sites so I have to take a day off everytime they do this, and it's now getting silly. 

Has anyone else had issues with Dell support? The first guy was spot on, wasn't in to speak with the second guy and I now appear to be worse off, with a damaged laptop..."

Dell PowerEdge R640 RAM modules increase
"Hi there,  


I have Dell PowerEdge R640, with  **370-ADND : 16Â GB RDIMM, 2.666Â MT/s, Dual Rank 8 modules.**

There is a request to upgrade current memory on the server itself, probably to double the amount of RAM, but that's still not defined. Server is not under support anymore.

Anyway, to move to the question.  
On Dell portal, this RAM module does not exist anymore. Only one with the same technology and speed is **Dell Memory Upgrade - 32GB - 2Rx4 DDR4 RDIMM 2666MHz****.**  


Will it be safe to upgrade it with this available module, with 2 modules (each per CPU), or would you consider upgrading it with module bought from some reseller, or refurbished parts maybe?  


Thank you very much!"

Need help dealing with Dell customer support
"Hello everyone. 

I bought a Dell G3223Q during the Black Friday sales. Unfortunately when it got delivered to me it was DOA, as was confirmed by Dell tech support. Unfortunately I am stationed overseas with an APO address, and this is giving me a lot of issues. 

I was able to order this monitor directly from Dell using my APO address without any issues. Now I just keep getting a runaround from them. The first agent I talked to that confirmed that the monitor was DOA told me that I need to contact the federal support team. When I called them, they told me that's not correct, and I have to call their customer support. When I tried calling customer support, it was past their closing hours on Friday (my Saturday over here). I tried sending them an email, but never got a response back. 

I waited a week for an email response, and finally gave up. Went through the chat again, this time with customer support, on Friday (my Saturday). This guy told me that they can't mail me a replacement to my APO address, and I should just return this monitor, and order another one. I told him that I can't do that because the price on the monitor has gone up $200 since my order. I asked if they can give me a $200 discount code or credit, but he told me that the best they can do is 10% off (which is hillarious because at the time there was already a 10% of discount code on their website, and nowhere close to compensate for the $200 difference). I asked this agent to speak to his supervisor since it's obvious that he lacks the authority to solve my problem. He told me that he submitted a request and they will contact me by email. 

Now it's been more than 2 business days since then. I still haven't heard a single thing back in my email, whether it was from the first time I emailed them, or the second time that they claimed they will get back to me. Can anyone give me some kind of a suggestion on how I can approach this issue. I really like Dell monitors, and would like to get a working one of G3223Q to use as my main screen, but I am not willing to spend more money because they sent me a dead unit. I feel like it's insane that they are more than happy to send my order to an APO address (with me paying the shipping cost, which I'm OK with since it has to go through USPS priority), but somehow they can't mail me a replacement to the same address as on my account. 

I am going to try calling them again tomorrow since it's obvious that their chat's aren't getting me anywhere. I always prefer the chat box because that way I can keep a record of everything that was said to me, but it's not worth it when it only takes me to their lowest level support that isn't authorized to properly fix issues like this. Any suggestions are appreciated."
The proper french-canadian keyboard with an ANSI keyboard (not ISO)
"&#x200B;

[The proper CSA\/CMS keyboard is the official keyboard layout of Canada and is standardized for 47 and 48 keys.](https://preview.redd.it/wuxkjr36a17a1.png?width=1696&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=547a305db8c6b7d359ebd4d7d4f806716fb49b4f)

Just an advice to DELL if you listen to me, **if you really want to use an ANSI keyboard for your french-canadian customers** (without the extra key), use the Canadian multilingual STANDARD layout with labels printed in french or use neutral standardized pictograms, all character in the group1/level 3 (|Â¤{}\[\]Â¬\`\~Â°Â«Â»<>) and the characters in the group 2/level1-2 aligned on the right (Å“Ã¦Â§Â¶\~Ã—Ã·, etc). This layout (the CMS CAN/CSA Z243.200.92) was standardized for both ISO and ANSI keyboards.

The traditional canadian-french keyboard layout is ISO only and the french guillemets with Z and X can be typed only with the CMS layout. Be smart, use the CMS layout properly, please. Thanks."

Dell S2522HG calibration settings and ICC profile
"As many have already noticed, the monitor seems to come with slightly off colors by default.

I calibrated my Dell S2522HG using a Datacolor Spyder 5 and although each panel is slightly different, I decided to share the resulting settings and ICC profile.

My settings are as follows:

```
Game>Response Time: Super Fast
Display>Sharpness: 40%
Contrast: 75%
Brightness: 76%
```


Game>Preset Modes>Custom Color>Gain:

```
R: 100%
G: 97%
B: 100%
```


Game>Preset Modes>Custom Color>Offset:

```
R: 50%
G: 50%
B: 48%
```


This already improves things, at least on my panel, alot.

If needed, you can also try my icc profile (in conjunction with the settings above):
https://ufile(dot)io/f/mxk92

It should be noted, again, that every panel is slightly different and my profile might not be perfectly right for your device. But trying different settings and profiles costs like 3 minutes and may result in a better viewing experience, so I thought I'd share."
"DEll G15 5515 (Ryzen7 5800h, RTX3060) temperatures"
"About temperatures:

In stock, my CPU temperature is 93c, 101 with G-Mode.In stock, my GPU temperature is 86 with or without G-Mode.

To cool GPU I have two setup options. The first one is very cold 65-70 degrees, the second keeps the GPU at 70-75 degrees. Both can be played with good fps, but naturally the second one is more productive, for example, at 5-10 fps in cyberpunk 2077.

1. 700mv 1500mhz +300vram (65-70c)
2. 812mv 1800mhz (70-75c)

I also know that some people on the RTX3060 keep a frequency of 1800 mhz at 806 mv, but I tried it and it doesnâ€™t work for me, and it doesnâ€™t affect temperatures so much in general, 1-2 degrees maximum.

Also i use Ryzen Controller. Temp limit 80c, CPU TDP 20w, Long Boost TDP 25w. And i set colling mod in AWCC with 100% fans for heavy games. My CPU temperature stays at around 79-81 degrees in various games and tasks. The temperature in idle is about 55-70. Turning off turbo boost cuts performance, but if you use these settings, then the processor has the opportunity to reach maximum frequencies. For example, games load faster, applications open faster than without turbo boost. Especially since even when it is turned off, such low temperatures cannot be achieved.All obtained by experience with viewing so many resources and forums.

I did the replacement of thermal paste with Thermalright TF8 and replaced the thermal pads with liquid ones with a thermal conductivity of 20w. This gave a result, but not very much.

All screenshots were taken on a pre-warmed computer to show temperatures correctly.

In terms of temperatures in stock, this laptop is a pain in the ass.

Inspiron 1525 Display Upgrade
"Hi all! I have a Dell Inspiron 1525 that currently has a 800x1280 screen (and core 2 duo T8100) that I would like to upgrade to a 1050x1680 display (for nostalgia, and not for actual use).

However, when I enter the service tag in the parts-people website, it says that the display is incompatible with my laptop. The only oddity in the display listing that I noticed was the mention of an ambient light sensor, which my 1525 doesn't have.

I was also wondering if the 1050x1680 display would be too high resolution for core 2 duo integrated graphics to run smoothly.

Any help and insight would be appreciated!

Edit: I called parts-people and they said that they only had 1 type of LVDS cable for the 1525, and that the display should work. If I remember to, I will update this post if it works when I install the display."

Help! Buggy GPU draining my battery.
"Hello guys, I ran into an issue on my XPS 15 9570 and I would be grateful for any help.

&#x200B;

Last week, I started getting BSOD errors on my PC without any major fault or warning. I initially figured out that it was coming from the GPU.

&#x200B;

I tried uninstalling the drivers completely with DDU and re-installing them. The issue still persisted.

&#x200B;

The only way I could use my PC was to uninstall my GPU drivers. Now, I've noticed that the battery life of my PC has been halved ever since I removed the GPU drivers.

&#x200B;

It has been cut down from 7 hours to about 3 hours. I took the PC to a tech and I was told a possible issue might be a faulty GPU on the motherboard.

&#x200B;

I live outside of dell's official reach and I don't know how I can get a replacement or qualified help. Anyone have any experience with this?

Guys Please draw this post to attention.. Bios Freezing in Inspiron 3593
"[Orginal Post](https://www.dell.com/community/Inspiron/Bios-Freezes-Inspiron-3593/m-p/8321315#M155984)

Bios version: 1.24.0 up to date

All System ,drivers &Â  kernel is up to date !

Greetings, I have a **Dell Inspiron 3593** with up-to-date bios. The *BIOS menu freezes unexpectedly*  when I try to change the boot sequence. If I have multiple boot options  in the bios, then if I try to remove the old boot option, the bios menu  suddenly freezes. I have to restart my laptop by holding down the power  button for three seconds.The OS now randomly freezes as a result of a  recent BIOS update. My current operating system is Fedora with kernel *6.0.13-300.fc37.*  The operating system randomly freezes, requiring me to hold down the  power button to shut it down; additionally, the system freezes after  waking up from sleep.

**I'm 100% sure this post will be ignored, just like the previous one.**  Due to a graphics issue, I switched to Linux, and here we are again at  the Dell Glitch Matrix, where every post is ignored. I would be grateful  if anyone could report this to the Dell Driver Team or let me know how  to contact them to report a bug.

*Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays, everyone!*

I'm  stuck with a buggy BIOS full of glitches, and Dell only provides an  update with security fixes, not device-specific bug fixes. Myan, this is  my only laptop. What should I do? go and cry in the corner? I don't  know where to report this issue. I hope someday, at some point in my  life, a Dell Bios engineer or developer can look at this post. I don't  want to make this post long because at random times, my OS can freeze!

Thank You!

**Note from my deep heart:** *I'm  very sad because I don't have money to buy a new laptop, nor do I have  the fix for the issue. If you want to help, please share the post or  post on other platforms where Dell driver developers can see the  Inspiron 3593 bios freezing issue.*

My laptop battery suspends itself by around 28%.

I have to open up the laptop's bottom and physically reconnect the battery to get it to work again ( sometimes it will work on its own). It's a weird problem so if anyone can help.

G5 5587 Battery Issues
"My G5 5587's battery has been on the ropes for awhile and kicked it when the amber battery light at the base started to flash. I bought another battery and replaced it today. With the new battery installed, the amber flashing light persists and the laptop wont power on under battery power. It boots just fine under AC power - and dell's Power management app says the battery is in excellent condition.   


I left it plugged in for about an hour and the battery charge % didn't change.   


Is it dead? Can I do this myself or should I take it to a shop. Thanks"
Problem with Dell: No bootable devices found
"Hi, my Dell Inspiron 7306 2n1 has just started to deliver that problem and I donâ€™t know how to fix it or if it is necessary to send it to repair. Iâ€™ve run the advanced test in the system to ensure everything was ok and it is apparently.
Once I try to turn my laptop on, it appears a message that says: abnormal status reported by rapid storage technology UEFI driver.
The only unusual thing I can think of is a notification that appeared yesterday about something that needs to be disabled because it was causing some problem in the ram?(I canâ€™t remember well so disregard this if does not make sense)"
Connecting Dell U2419HC monitor to Lenovo Thinkpad T14 Gen 3 laptop via USB-C

Can anyone A) confirm if this is possible and B) tell me exactly what kind of USB-C cable I would need to accomplish this?

Thanks a bunch!"

"I'm trying to get my XPS 13 9315 back to factory default. The BIOS tool doesn't work, dell command center won't install, and performance is noticeably off. Is there an ISO of the pre-configured windows?"
"Hi all, I got a XPS 13 for work and originally wanted to put fedora on it and use it for some docker containers, but getting the drivers to work was a royal pain in the ass. I gave up, attempted to use the BIOS reset tool, but after letting it run for hours, it failed. I tried installing windows, but I couldn't get the dell drivers on it, and the command center tool won't acknowledge the machine.

Very frustrating. All I want to do is reset the damn thing. Is there an ISO out there I can download? Anything at all?"

Dell latitude 7490 windows 11 and the people's republic of china?
"I was thinking of upgrading my dell latitude 7490 to windows 11. Doing the necessary checks the windows tool and whynot11 lead that the problem is the CPU. Going to the DELL website instead it says that windows 11 is supported on this model but it has this note that I don't quite understand:

Note: To meet regulatory requirements, computer models marked below with an asterisk (\*) DO NOT meet TPM requirements when shipped to the People's Republic of China.

From the two tests done with the two tools, however, it appears that the problem is NOT the TPM 2.0 which appears to be present. Does anyone know anything about this? have you tried this dell model with win 11?

Random shutdown when on battery and sleep on AC (please read)?
"Hi

Purchased a  brand new Alienware/Dell laptop. It has happened 2/3 times from the day I owned the machine on the 24th of November 2022.

I am experiencing a problem or taken notice. When the machine is on battery power, it will shut down all of a sudden or while on AC plugged in, it will go into sleep mode.

For example,  it can happen anytime, one day/weeks it will work fine while next day it can just take place. I checked the event viewer and also the Reliability view history and error only showing as unexpected shutdown. I would say it did not happen since last 20 days until last night, when it occurred again. 

I have updated all the drivers and bios which is up to date. I ran the diagnostic test and its shows as passed. Power option wise, I have turned OFF, preventing machine going into sleep/hibernation . I have also turned off fast boot"

"Dell 32"" Curve 4K Monitor (S3221QS) - Orange tint"
"Hi Guys

This was my first time buying the Dell 32"" Curve 4K Monitor (S3221QS) along with a new pc (Aurora R13 w/RTX 3090 video card).  I had to return the 1st monitor because brightness was low, had a orange warm tint, 4K and 1080p videos were soft if not fuzzy.  Second monitor resolved the bright ness issue and better 4K quality, but the orange warm tint still exist and 1080p videos are still soft compared to being sharp.  

I am using my old U2412mb Ultra Sharp as a second monitor and the difference are pretty obvious; no orange tint, sharper website images and colors seem more accurate.  I tried to match the setting to both the monitors, but the difference are still there.

Anyone know how to adjust the tint for the S3221QS?  The manual controls are limited and presets are either too warm or too cold.  I am thinking of getting a Spyder X calibrator to see if it can fix the issues, but I would like to know if you guys have any other suggestions.  Thanks in advance."
"How can I fix poor sounding audio on a brand new XPS 9520, or somehow disable MaxxAudio?"
"My brand new Dell XPS 15 9520 arrived a few days ago, and I haven't been able to get acceptable audio with it at any point. I first noticed that my external headphones/speakers using the 3.5mm jack  sounded processed with a lot of harsh high-end frequencies (compared to any other laptop or audio source for the same audio files), which I've realized is from Waves MaxxAudio, based on several past posts. Turning everything to ""off"" in the MaxxAudio interface still does not  produce the raw audio sound.

I tried installing different versions of audio drivers per other posts I'd seen, and I now can get 3 different audio setups that all partially work and are partially broken:

* Using Realtek's audio driver 6.0.9369.1 (from 6/21/2022) *or* 6.0.9430.1 (from 10/25/2022) (and reinstalling the Waves MaxxAudio driver [here](https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-hk/drivers/driversdetails?driverid=mx1pp&oscode=w2021&productcode=xps-15-9520-laptop) by following this workaround [here](https://www.dell.com/community/XPS/Install-Waves-MaxxAudio-Application-failed-jack-audio-input/m-p/8252318/thread-id/101080/highlight/true), if I'd previously removed it):  with these default drivers, the sound through any headphones or external speakers ends up sounding processed and harsh (with more high end  frequencies), as mentioned before. But the built-in laptop speakers sound okay.
   * I tried disabling the Waves and Realtek services per [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Dell/comments/6cumny/how_do_i_remove_this_maxxaudio_garbage/i6mtf3o/) and related script on GitHub [here](https://github.com/GrzegorzKozub/xps).  This worked for a brief moment, where internal and external audio sounded right. However, then detecting headphones in the 3.5mm jack would subsequently stop working (if unplugged and plugged back in), so only built-in speakers would be usable sadly.
   * I also tried turning off ""Audio Enhancements"" for the external speakers via the Windows Sound options, but then audio stops completely for the external headphones/speakers.
* Using Microsoft's ""High Definition Audio Device"" driver 10.0.22621.608:Â  with this driver, any headphones or external speakers sound normal/unprocessed/working. However, the built-in laptop speakers then sound absolutely terrible and tinny, with no low-end bass frequencies whatsoever, while also being quieter and having really harsh high-end frequencies. I tried installing this driver based on [this audio thread](https://www.dell.com/community/XPS/XPS-15-9560-Doing-away-with-Waves-MaxxAudio-Fixed/m-p/7343590/highlight/true#M32109), where others had noticed annoying processed sound for their audio.
* Using [this open-source Realtek generic UAD driver](https://github.com/pal1000/Realtek-UAD-generic):  I was able to install these drivers, and external headphones/speakers sounded good/unprocessed. However, volume controls ended up not working properly when using built-in speakers:  decreasing the system volume level would end up making the sound more and more muffled, but it wouldn't significantly reduce the loudness, where even very low levels (like level 2 out of 100) would be fairly loud. Reducing an individual application's volume would work/sound fine, as long as system volume was up all the way, but that's not very practical.

None of the above seems reasonable. 

Does anyone know if there's anything that can be done to get **both** my built-in laptop speakers *and* external headphones/speakers working properly? Thank you in advance! (Dell technical support says they'll let me exchange the laptop for a new one since, but I have very little confidence that a new one will be any different.)

"Optiplex 3020 not turning on; amber blinks 2,3"
"    Hey everyone! I have an old Optiplex 3020 Tower computer, and the RAM recently started being weird. I upgraded it from 8 to 16 a few months ago, and now they seem to be rejected.
    Originally, the computer just bootlooped without any flashing, so I tried removing the CMOS battery for 10 minutes so the BIOS would reset. The last time this happened, resetting the BIOS seemed to get the computer to boot up. But this time, when I tried to turn it on, the power button flashed 2 times, then 3 times.
    Additionally, when I upgraded the RAM, the motherboard would only accept one card at a time, regardless of the card and slot it was in. I tried removing one card to test this now, but it doesn't change anything. I know the computer recognizes the RAM because when I removed both cards, it beeped a few times to let me know there was no RAM.
    The official guide from Dell says the code means ""system board, memory or CPU failure,"" but most forums and YouTube videos seem to say it's really only memory related. I haven't tried all possible combinations with the two sticks yet, but I probably will soon. Worst comes to worst, I can probably dig up the original RAM that came with the machine to see if it's the new RAM that's faulty/incompatible.

    Edit: I swapped in the original RAM that came with the computer, and it worked. So my theory is that I broke the BIOS somehow and it won't accept anything but the default amount of RAM after being reset."
Adapter to use Dell 5pin fans with 4pin connectors?
"Today I was cleaning out my room and I scrapped some Dell PCs for whatever parts seem useful, and I came across several Delta, Foxconn, Datech, and Sanyo Denki fans. Best I can tell these are all very good fans, and very high airflow aswell, most of these are rated for 150CFM, id love to repurpose these fans in some other systems however Dell uses a 5pin connector to connect these to their motherboards. Only 4 of these pins are in use and the 4th pin is PWM. The connector can be jammed into a normal fan header, but it has to be inserted ""upside down"" in order for the pins to match up and not cause electrical issues. I was wondering if anyone knew of a better way to go about using these fans? 

Does anyone know of any 5pin to standard 4pin adapters, prehaps on Ebay, that allows me to utlize these very interesting fans? 

I tried looking myself but I only can seem to find adapters that do the very opposite of this (that would be allowing for standard 4pin fans to be plugged into the dell proprietary 5pin connector.)

Thanks in advance for any help!"
Dell not fixing G3 laptop under warranty
Dell Latitude Shift Key Bug
"I'm preparing a rollout of about 200 Dell Latitude 7530 / 7330 Notebooks. I've used Dell Image Assist with Driver injection for the staging of the devices and there is also Dell Command Update installed on them.

Now I've encountered a wierd bug...On some devices, when using key combinations involving the shift key, the keyboard will input two special characters. The first one will be as if I didn't press the shift key and the second one will be the one that actually should be written when using the key combination.

So instead of writing ""!"" it will write ""Â¨!"" (Swiss Keyboard).

I tried using USB-Keyboards and the on screen keyboard but the issue still persists, so I don't think it's a hardware problem.

I hope one of y'all have an Idea what could be causing this. I spent hours looking for forum posts etc. but there was no one with this exact issue.

Edit: I also disabled all the sticky keys, filter keys etc.

Edit: Found the Issue :) It's actually the dell display manager 2.0! It has a hotkey function and for that it's basically running a keylogger in the background that records every single keypress. For some reason it's buggy and adds random inputs to some key combinations. I'm contacting Dell tomorrow and will report the bug."

Prevent Swollen Battery Problem - XPS 9500 15
"Hi All 

I just replaced the battery on my XPS after swelling. The Dell technician said this was caused by the laptop constantly having an AC charger plugged in. I don't use the power brick but connect the laptop to an external monitor 100% of the time so the USBC-C from the monitor charges the laptop. Go figure!!

Anyway, now that I have a replacement battery in and running, what are the preventative measures I can take to minimize the chances of this occurring again.

Any BIOS settings, Dell Power Management settings I need to set?

Thanks"
Dell Vostro 270s Memory Upgrade

Multiple Optiplex 3070s with hard drive not found error (but work for a while after a reboot) ?
"I work for an IT company, we service small businesses. Over the past couple of days, we have received calls on 3 optiplex 3070s that reboot or freeze while user is working, and upon restart display an error which states â€œerror code 2000-0141, verification code: 75384, hard drive: no hard drive detectedâ€ 

However, if you shut down the PC, and boot it again, it gets to windows and works (for a while). Iâ€™ve seen this issue before and  making sure Fast Boot & Launch CSM are enabled and Secure boot is disabled in the BIOS fixed it. Those options are configured in the BIOS now, but the issue still persists. Anyone have a fix?"

XPS 8940 stuck at boot
"EDIT: I was able to reset the BIOS by following this procedure [https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000126023/how-to-reset-real-time-clock-rtc-to-recover-your-dell-desktop-system#Shortcut\_1](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000126023/how-to-reset-real-time-clock-rtc-to-recover-your-dell-desktop-system#Shortcut_1) With the BIOS reset, I was able to change the SATA mode back to RST and Windows boots correctly now. I am dropping the idea of dual boot for now given this complexity (I do NOT want to reinstall Windows).

I was preparing to install Arch Linux as dual boot on my XPS 8940 that already has a Windows install. Since Gparted could not see the NVME drives, I looked up online and saw the advice was to change the SATA mode from RST to AHCI. I did this but now am stuck at the DELL logo. Regardless of if I choose F2or F12, the loading bar shows to be full and at the top right hand corner I see ""Preparing to load Setup"" or ""Preparing One Time Boot Menu"". The computer just sits there. If I allow it to boot straight up, it stops at the DELL logo.

How do I access the BIOS again to reverse this change? Reset the CMOS?"

Netflix 4K playback
"I have a 4K laptop - Dell XPS 15 9510 \[4K\] - which meets all requirements for Netflix 4K playback; but have learned that 4K playback doesn't just happen out of the box.

I bought the Windows HEVC extension which is what seems to be necessary for this- but Netflix (both on Microsoft Edge and on the Windows app) are now only displaying the HDR logo, rather than 4K & HDR, like it would on my Amazon Fire Stick. I am also on the (Netflix) Premium Ultra HD plan and have set my playback to best quality to ensure that it defaults to 4K.

What's weird is that some titles are indeed now streaming in 4K resolution (which I can see from keying in CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+D), but then others which should be streaming in 4K are at standard HD. Really getting frustrated at this point, as one of the reasons I bought this laptop was to watch 4K content.

Any help would be really appreciated ðŸ™.

UPDATE: Seems to actually play all 4K content at 4K resolution after a few minutes. No 4K logo though, which is strange."
OG XPS 13 Owners (9350/9360/9370/etc.) - Upgrade to XPS 13 9305 / 9310 model?
"Hi,

I love my 9360, but I feel like it's time for an upgrade after almost 7 years. Looking to see if any of the OG XPS 13 owners (9343/9350/9360/etc.) have made a jump to a newer XPS 13 (9305/9310) models and how your experience is? To be clear, I am NOT talking about the XPS 13 Plus model. I have read the cheaper XPS 13 9305 model is very similar to the OG devices, but not sure in terms of trackpad size, keyboard, etc.

Anyone who made a similar jump and can share your feedback would be super appreciated!

Dell WD15 ports not working

So I have a Dell Latitude 7390 connected to a Dell U2412M via a WD15 dock.

"Dell G7 players, how on earth do you play games?"
"I have a Dell G7 15 7588 laptop and it has been a **terrible** experience overall. Every time I play a game, I consistently hit temperatures over 100 degrees Celsius, causing thermal throttling, making every game completely unplayable. And this is **after** replacing the thermal paste on both the CPU and GPU!

**Let me ask,** **how did you all fix the thermal throttling issues and play like normal gamers?** I'm trying to play Escape from Tarkov... (i7-8750H, GTX 1060 Max-Q)

**SOLUTION**: one solution I had was lower the Maximum Processor State from 100% to 90% in the Battery Advanced Power Settings (Control Panel -> Hardware -> Power Options -> Change plan settings (whatever plan you use, I use Balanced) -> Change advanced power settings -> Processor power management -> Maximum processor state -> Set both ""**On battery""** and ""**Plugged in""** to 90% (default is 100%). This will lower CPU performance but gave me better, lower temperature. This solution is the only one that ""worked,"" still high temps but a bit better for me."

Worth it to replace old laptop battery?
" I've been using my Dell XPS 9560, which is now about four years old, more recently for travel. The computer is actually I primarily use a desktop, but I find that I am needing my college laptop more and more. The main problem is that the battery life is absolutely abysmal, getting only just north of an hour maximum. Running a diagnostic shows that the battery capacity is only 23% of its max capacity.

I have looked into getting a battery, but the Dell replacement is $130 dollars. Having never really opened up my laptop and not even building my desktop, I am a little skittish to do so myself, but services are around $250.

I was wondering if anyone else has had an issue like this and what you did. Did you tough it out and instead save for a new laptop, or did you replace the battery? If so, how much of a difference did the new battery actually make?"

Dell Latitude 5500 [work] laptop HELP!
"Is this where I can go for some suggestions/answers as to why my laptop went blank?  I was working on it and it was responding slowly (I would type but the letters were very slow in appearing) and then it went black.  It would not shut down (power button stayed lit) and did not respond to any soft boot.  I pulled the charger and let it die.  Then, after Googling, I plugged in the charger, hit the power button and when the Dell logo appeared I hit F12.  Ran through all the tests and it showed no errors.  Yet, after I ran the tests it still wouldn't work.  Currently it is powered down (no charger and power button not lit) and will hopefully get suggestions/answers from this community.

SSD Updrade not booting
"Hi all and Merry Christmas! I have an XPS 9570 and I'm trying to upgrade from the factor 256 GB SSD to the 970 EVO Plus 1 TB SSD and having some issues. I used Macrium reflect to clone my SSD and it looked as if everything went right. When in EUFI settings on reboot, I switch the windows boot manager and my new partition in the boot sequence. Then, it kept blue screening with the error ""Stop code: inaccessible boot device"" until I switched back the boot sequence settings.

In my disk manager, my 1 TB new SSD shows that the OS (E:) is only ""basic data partition"" which I believe is the problem, but not sure (shown below). **My goal is to ultimately rip out the old 256 SSD and replace it with the 1 TB so I need the boot to work.** I'm not too great with computers and windows so I was using some Youtube tutorials... must have messed something up along the way.

Small Dell laptop parts
"Is there anyone who sells small Dell laptop parts?

My M7760 has an Ethernet port made of the set of 8 contact wires plus a small spring-loaded clip to retain the RJ45 connector.  Instead of a proper RJ45 socket this seems to be sort of a low-profile style connector.

The spring-loaded clip is fragile and I have broken it so it's no longer held in place by the little ""axle"" protrusions on the sides.

G15 5511 not recognizing external Monitors after Nvidia Game Ready Driver Updates
"Iâ€™ve got a G15 5511 w/ nVidia GeForce 3060 (6 GB) and running 2 Dell S2421HGF monitors via USB-c to HDMI through the Razer Thunderbolt 4 Dock.

After updating the nVidia Game Ready Drivers beyond 512.95, the external monitors arenâ€™t recognized through the dock. I can remove the TB4 dock and plug a monitor directly into the USBC on the PC and it works fine, but I lose all functionality of the dock. 

Iâ€™ve tried to have Windows detect the monitors while plugged into the dock. Reached out to Razer support and didnâ€™t get much back from them.

is this a Dell issue? A nVidia issue? Or a Razer issue? It seems like possibly a Razer issue, due to them functioning outside of the dock, but hoping someone has had some luck getting updated drivers through nVidia while running a similar setup.

Why is it IMPOSSIBLE to find Replacement Fans (CPU + GPU) for my Dell XPS 15 7590 laptop?
"Hey all. My laptop processor fan stopped working (have been getting error messages whenever I turn it on and it heats up like crazy) back in August. I had it checked immediately at a service shop in Montenegro, where they said the fan has to be replaced and replacement parts would take 60 days to ship. I am a digital nomad who moves around around once a month so couldn't get the part in Montenegro, and then again in Albania (where I was also for a month so couldn't get the fans delivered fast enough even though I tried through another service shop). Now I am in Bangladesh for a few months, and local shops here have failed me again. But I finally have someone from the US who is coming and can bring me whatever parts I need with them. But it seems literally impossible to find original parts from Dell for replacing my laptop fans. I looked on Amazon and E-bay and they only have replacement fans from Chinese companies with questionable reviews. Also looked at [parts-people.com](https://parts-people.com) , which seems to have original Dell fans for my laptop, but only has used parts and even they are out-of-stock for the CPU fan.

I cannot understand why it is so hard to find replacement fans for my laptop, even in the US. I would be very grateful if someone can guide me to the right sources  ðŸ™ðŸ™"
How do I stop Windows UI from skipping/stuttering?
"I have a Dell Inspiron 7706 2n1. It is running Windows 11, has Intel 1165G7 processor with integrated Iris Xe Graphics and the dedicated GPU is Nvidia GeForce MX350.

Shortly after I bought it in October, I noticed that Windows UI skips/stutters every 8 - 10 seconds. After many weeks of troubleshooting, I found out that the skips/stutters go away when I disable Nvidia display driver in Device manager. I have tried drivers from:

Dell https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-ng/product-support/servicetag/0-VU5BdnMvYStGUU5ZcVl1UU5ad2dndz090/drivers

Nvidia https://www.nvidia.com.br/Download/driverResults.aspx/197461/en-us

And Windows update, but the skips/stutters still persist.

Recently, I discovered that the skips/stutters go away when I'm running the ""Adjust image settings with preview' page in Nvidia control panel. So I run it at all times minimized. The render uses about 13% GPU utilization.

I have another observation: when the skip happens, a process I see in task manager called ""System"" has a high CPU usage for a split second that the skip/stutter occurs. it also briefly makes use of the dedicated GPU for that split second. This happens every 8-10 seconds. To investigate further, I right-click on ""System"" process and select ""Go to details"". On the details page, I right-click on ""System"" and select ""Open file location"". It brings me to this path ""C:\Windows\System32\ntoskrnl.exe. The ntoskrnl.exe file description is NT Kernel & System. Do you make any sense of this observation?

Please how can I stop these skips/stutters?"

Precision 5530 Issues with Sleep and front LED random behavior
"Hi all,

Recently made a post about purchasing a used Precision 5530, and have since made a purchase and am very happy with it.  It has a fresh install of Windows 11 Pro on it.  Onto my issues.

The laptop is set to sleep upon closing the lid or pressing the power button, as one would generally expect.  In real use, the laptop does not operate in this way, and in fact, does not operate in much of a consistent pattern.

Currently, when pressing the power button, selecting ""Sleep"" in Windows, or closing the lid, the display turns off, but the keyboard backlight and front LED remain on, and the fans continue in whatever state they were already in (on or off).   Sometimes, triggering sleep causes the laptop to go to the lockscreen and stay there as well.

Additionally, while triggering sleep through the above described methods, and randomly during usage, the front white LED will randomly blink on and off, stay on, or turn off.

I have seen the laptop enter a sleep state before, but the front LED didn't pulse slowly like I'd expect (it remained off).  But in general, I don't have a reliable way to turn the computer on/off quickly, and I can't tell from the outside when it's on/sleeping/off due to the sporadic nature of the front LED indicator.

I've googled this issue and found many posts pointing to all sorts of things, but did not find anything conclusive.  I will continue digging but would like to hear if anyone has had this experience and if they were able to solve it.  Thanks!

**Edit:**  I seem to have fixed the sleep issue by disabling Windows Connected Sleep, but the LED randomly flashing still remains.  When in full (S3) sleep, the light still flashes a few times and then stays off sometimes, or stays on other times.

**Edit 2:**  Got a little further.  The random flashing is not so random, and it's related to the lower power USB-C charger I'm using while I wait for my 130W brick to arrive.  When unplugged, the LED indicator stays off.  But I imagine that the LED indicator would remain on while in an idle/normal state.  Still not 100% solved, but maybe it just stays on when charging from proper 130W charger?  We will see soon."

Problems with G15 5525
"Hello there

I have been experiencing some problems with my G15 5525 lately. It runs on Windows 11, has a AMD Ryzen 7 6800H CPU and NVidia GeFore RTX 3050 Ti GPU.

When I put the system in sleep mode and let it be like that for more than half an hour, a critical event happens where the kernel suddenly loses power.

This characterized by me not being able to wake the system up quickly and when I reboot, the system goes into recovery mode.

I am experiencing other issues, i.e. the Alienware Command Center application doesn't give me the choice to choose other thermal settings like quiet or G-mode. This issue happend after I had to reset my OS for a different reason.

Can that resest have triggered my current problems or do I need to give more information for this? I tried looking bith problems up online, but could'nt find anyone with the exact problem I had...

Dell G5 15 laptop Keyboard malfunction
"So, I have a Dell G5 15 laptop running windows 10, that recently started having problems with the keyboard.

Typing some letters seems to miss keypresses, and sometimes it double presses the same keys.

So far it looks like the main affected keys are t,y, Backspace, Tab and the left shift key.

The issue isn't constant, but regular enough to make typing and logging into websites painful.

At first I thought it might have been Chrome, or a website in chrome having issues and causing the glitching, but fully closing chrome and using Firefox hasn't fixed it.

I've tried restarting the laptop numerous times, checking to see if there are any updates, nothing, and no help

The interesting / annoying thing is I'm pretty sure I've had this appear in previous laptops (also dell), that actually replaced due to the issue.

I feel this is some kind of software issue, over a hardware issue, however it's entirely possible that it is hardware related. I haven't ruled anything out at this point.

Is this something that others have encountered?"

Looking for an online post regarding Ubuntu configuration on the XPS 13 Plus 9320 with Dell specific Ubuntu drivers.
"I have to install Ubuntu on a Windows version of the Laptop, I remember seeing somewhere detailed instructions from Dell on the different ppa and commands you have to perform to add the Dell specific Ubuntu drivers, example:

Not sure where to post this but I have questions about my new Dell G15 5520 laptop and Alienware ?
"I recently had to get it swapped since the previous one was defective with the screen flickering and such especially when it wasnâ€™t plugged into the charge, even tho this one is pretty good and going well so far, I was wondering if thereâ€™s any advice to avoid anything like that happening ? Iâ€™m just a little worried as to what caused that with the other one. I also have one minor problem with this one, the battery was at 65% at one point and dropped down to 20% in only about thirty mins or so and said it couldnâ€™t recognise the charger. The charger seems to be okay now but I was wondering what causes the battery drainage ? Any advice and such would be cool ! Another very very minor thing and probably isnâ€™t too important is the keyboard lighting, itâ€™s a reddish orange yet Iâ€™ve seen others being able to change their colour ? Is it just this type of laptop that doesnâ€™t allow that ? Anyways, thanks again advance !"

Realtek USB GbE family controller not working as intended.
"Hey everyone.

I have a PC which I have been struggling with for quite some time now.

The issue is that the laptop, when connected to the docking station, simply cannot connect to the ethernet.

It will say ""identifying"" and end up with ""network cannot be identified"".

I have attempted to update to the newest drivers, reinstalling Windows, different docking station, cables, you name it.

I have found a temporary solution for the issue which is basically selecting the device in devmgmt and installing a driver already on the pc, and then selecting the Realtek (Windows) driver.

This only works temporarily though, when rebooting (not always) it will relapse to select the wrong driver again.

Hope someone can help me."

Can Latitude 5401/5501 handle CPU intensive tasks for hours/days? (Heat)
"Thinking of buying a Dell Latitude 5401 or 5501 with i7 9850H cpu.

I develop high-performance software and this will run on the laptop for hours/days. CPU could be 75%+ for hours. I will leave it on my desk, with airflow underneath.

(I could build a new machine but seems far cheaper and easier to buy a second hand, high-spec laptop)

I've seen a few mentions of heat issues with the 5401. Is this true? Was this restricted to the 14"" or does it affect the 5501/15.6"" too?

No point buying it if it's just going to melt."

Dell OptiPlex 3020 SFF - GTX 1050 not Working Properly

After alot of moving around and taking things out, I finally got it to fit and when booting, it says to connect a 6-Pin PCIe Cable. However, the PSU in this OptiPlex doesn't have that.

Monitor display lag
"Just got the S3222DGM. I donâ€™t know how else to describe this except as lag. Itâ€™s not screen tearing. When I play a game, it will play at 100+ fps but the display will lag and look weird (even if an offline game). Itâ€™s also noticeable outside of games, like if Iâ€™m on my computer browser, the display is laggy instead of smooth. I went into the control panel and made it the correct specs (1440p 144hz) but it still looks weird. Iâ€™m not good with computers so Iâ€™m not sure what else could be causing these issues."

How to leave review on Dell product?
"Purchased a Dell monitor.  When I turn off the monitor every night two back lights stay on. 2 months later I am getting dead pixels all over my screen. I was told if I qualify for the warranty I will receive a refurbished product and will be required to mail in my old monitor or be charged for the refurbished monitor.  The only way I would get a new monitor is if I had made this claim within 30 days of purchasing the monitor.  

I am wondering if anyone knows how to leave a product review for dell monitors on their website.  Planned obsolescence of 30 days is putrid.  I will never purchase another dell product so long as I live."

Ultrawide Gaming Monitor up to 1500â‚¬
"Currently, the AW3423Dw seems to be the benchmark if you want to buy an ultrawide monitor for gaming.
Is the monitor as well as the firmware and the QD-Oled technology currently mature enough to order a model for 1299â‚¬ (delivery at the end of January) or does it possibly make sense to go for another monitor with an RTX 4080?
Thanks a lot!

1. how much money are you willing to spend?
1500â‚¬

2. what are the main requirements you have for the monitor?
What screen diagonal (inches) do you want the monitor to have? 32-34 inch
What resolution should it have? Full HD (1920x1080), WQHD (2560x1440) Ultra HD (3840x2160), or others such as UWQHD (3,440 x 1,440)? UWQHD+
What refresh rate (Hz) do you want? 60/120/144/240 Hz, etc.? 120 Hz+
Which panel technology (IPS, VA, TN...) should the monitor rely on? ...
Should the monitor support G-Sync or FreeSync? If so, which one? G Sync probably makes sense for RTX?
Which ports are needed? (Displayport, HDMI, DVI, etc.) Displayport

3. do you need the monitor for special programs and/or professionally? (e.g. photo editing) If yes, name programs and special requirements.
Exclusively gaming and for movies/youtube

4. do you use other additional monitors? What model, resolution, Hz, Gsync/Freesync and ports do they have? (Please include link to manufacturer or price comparison!)
None

5. which graphics card should the monitor be used with? Model and designation(Please with link to manufacturer or price comparison!):
MSI RTX 4080 Suprim X

6. do you have special wishes regarding the monitor? (Pivot function, wall mounting, color, manufacturer, lighting, etc.).
Playing games in a completely darkened room if that plays a role in the choice of display.

7. when do you want to buy the monitor? As soon as possible or can you wait a few weeks/months?
As soon as possible"

older Dell. black screen
"Hi
I have an older Dell laptop Inspirion 15 7000 series. i think approx 6 -8 years i dont remember when i bought it. I used to use it everyday, now I use it randomly. I haven't turned it on in about 2 weeks. Today I needed to do something on it and it won't power up. I got a new battery and a new power cord about 8 months ago. 
When I push the button I get a white light in the front. It lasts a few seconds then goes off. My screen doesn't do anything, remains black. It is plugged in.
For the last few months I've had to restart it to get it to connect or ""work"". But after restarting it's been fine. Any ideas or is it just dead now?"

XPS Power Delivery charger
"I own a Dell XPS 15 9520, and I charge it daily with a Belkin dual port 63w charger. My goal was to carry to University a single charger for my laptop, iPad and iPhone.

The charger can supply 60w on one port or 18w+45w when using both ports. The laptop does charge at 60w (although showing a slow charger warning), but when using both ports (45w), it randomly stops charging and start charging again, which I guess itâ€™s not good for the laptop.

I heard that the max charging rate you can achieve in an XPS over PD is 90w, and that some 100w chargers are capped at 60w as they can 100w but not 90w. I was looking for a GaN charger that can charge the XPS at 90w, while also having multiple ports. 

What has your experience been with the XPS and third-party PD chargers? Any charger suggestions?"

Precision M4800 panel DOWNgrade
"Hello there,

my M4800 has a 4k panel. Some may want it but it's actually overkill to me. Even switching to a lower resolution the result is bad font aliasing and ""blurry"" sensation when reading text.

My old M4600 has a FHD display which is much better for daily use. Serious tasks can be made connecting an external hi-res display, IMHO.

My aim is to make a DOWNgrade of the panel. 4K M4800s have a 40 pin connector and compatible options are few. I'd like to place there a FHD siplay but they are 30 pins.... is there a way to use a 30 pin display on a 40 pin board?  30 to 40 pin cable converters does have sense?

Many many thanks"
Vostro 3888 Bios Password
"A customer brought me their Vostro 3888 desktop. They bought second hand. Its a 10th gen i7. They had installed a 512gb nvme and 3 x 2tb SSD.

The drives are not working so upon investigation I saw they were disabled in the BIOS.

So the 30+ years of tech in me says ok I will just clear the cmos password and be done. Come to find out the Vostro 3888 does not have a clear cmos or passwd jumper. This has to be preformed via RTC reset.

I followed the directions on the dell website (hold power in for 30-35 secs). Nothing works to clear the bios password. Tried removing cmos battery. Saw other posts that says the power led will flash 3 times but in my case only flashes twice.

Can this bios password be cleared or is the customer going to have to shop for another PC?"

Need advice on upgrading to a new monitor. 4k scaling at 1080p vs 1440p monitor
"Hi folks

I'm looking for an upgrade from my Dell 4k 27"" screen. I use it mainly for coding. The config I use for my most comfortable use is to scale it to 1080p.

My question would be if I'm buying a new monitor, should I stick to 4k(either 27"" or 32"") or should I go for 1440p monitor instead? As the price of these two is much different. If the crisp of the text is not noticeable at that scaling, why would I bother to pay more for the 4k?

Aspect ratio is also my concern as well as I never used the 21:9 before.

Current model: Dell 2721QS

Consider list: 2723QE, 3223QE, P3421WE(curved), P3421W(curved)

Should I replace my Dell G7 battery?

Dell refused to replace defective monitor without a reason.
"Hello everyone, 

I am seeking help. Dell refusing to honor the warranty.

I bought Alienware 27 Inch Gaming Monitor AW2721D from amazon in 2020 and it has 3 year warranty.

This year my monitor started displaying a vertical line that is discolored which is annoying. 
I contacted dell support the first time, everything went well and they told me within 3 days you will get a replacement.  I was amazed how fast they responded and thought it was too good to be true.
After a week with no reply,  I sent an email to check the status and they replied they rejected the warranty claim because they couldn't verify my information and contact original owner. I contacted Amazon and they sent me back to dell. I contacted dell again and they told me to send a proof of purchase. I sent the reciept and they agreed and told me within 3 days you will recieve the replacement. Still too good to be true.
A week passed and they rejected my claim again saying my billing address is not from USA. To my reply billing address has nothing to do with the shipment. The shipment address was in USA and billing address is for the card and not necessary where I live. After sorting it out by logic and they agreed, they escalated it to another department. They agreed with the replacement and again told me with 3 days you will get a replacement. 
And surprise surprise after a week when I contacted them, this is their replay 
"" We apologize for any inconvenience however we did not receive the necessary approvals for replacement from the concerned team.

Hence, unfortunately, we would not be able to comply with your request for monitor replacement""

They have no valid reason on why they refused to honor the warranty to an expensive monitor.
What can I do? I told them I can provide them to whatever information they want and still no luck.
The warranty will end dec 2023. Screen defect is similar to some users that had the same monitor and they got replacement easily. It is obvious something wrong with this monitor and dell refusing to honor the warranty.

Sorry for the long post, i am venting my frustration on how big company can screw customer for a defective equipment without a reason..."
Dell G15 5510 Updated the audio driver and now the speakers are literal trash.

Now it works for like 30 seconds.  Keeps saying ""windows stopped this program because it reported problems"".

I've also tried to install older versions of the realtek audio driver but nada, still the same low volume tinny sounds. I don't know what to do anymore. My sound was perfectly fine and the native drivers don't work for me.

***After installing the new SSD, the machine boots perfectly, but the haptic trackpad no longer works correctly.***

It behaves almost as if one of the buttons is now permanently depressed / clicked;
The cursor will highlight all the desktop icons as I try to move the cursor, and it displays the little selection rectangle when I am NOT clicking buttons / pressing on the pad, but merely swiping my finger around to move the cursor.

Not sure if it matters but the new SSD is *double-sided*, whereas the OEM (ironically was also western digital!) was *single-sided*. 
It seems to fit a bit more snugly in there, thatâ€™s for sureâ€¦
I used Macrium Reflect to clone the old SSD onto the new one.


***ETA: The reason I mention this is***; 

Obviously the XPS is a very slim laptop. It seems the double-sided SSD might not allow the bottom cover to fully & completely re-seat / snap in. I'm still researching & working with it, but I could very well see the added thickness of the double vs. single-sided SSD interfering with some of the plastic hooks / snaps that help seat the bottom cover.

I'm not sure if that could have any impact on the touchpad; helping keep the cables seated; if there is some capacitive connector that needs to be connected for the touchpad to work (almost like Apple's Smart Connector), etc.

I don't know what I don't know, so I am mentioning what has changed. 


Anyhow;

After cloning & installing the new 4TB WD Black 850X SSD, The machine booted right up perfectly, zero issues with the new drive after the clone. I was thrilled!

That said; the physical SSD install itself was very simple and easy as you can see here in the service manual I followed, but when I put it all back together the touchpad no longer works normally. 

Service Manual:

https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-us/xps-13-9320-laptop/xps-13-9320-service-manual/working-inside-your-computer?guid=guid-dd3ae169-a824-4f1d-832e-585b176f6faf&lang=en-us


The touchpad does kind of work, but it acts like one of the buttons is stuck, as the cursor just selects everything as I move it around, just like if you were holding down one of the buttons / clicking & dragging.

I have already uninstalled & reinstalled the driver; no luck.
I have also disconnected & firmly re-seated the touchpad cable, as identified in the service manual; no help.

I just got a $75 iFixIt tool kit, so Iâ€™ve got the proper equipment to carefully disconnect / re-connect those tiny little ribbon cables / connectorsâ€¦

When I boot into the BIOS, the touchpad DOES seem to work normally when moving around in the BIOS, so thatâ€™s encouraging.

Any ideas?"
"Optiplex 9020 running, no VGA display."
"I just recieved a used Optiplex 9020 and am using a new mini monitor. I get all the signs that the computer is running normally, like cpu fan running, power button solid white no flashing, cdrom drive opens and closes, etc. I get no signal on the VGA display. I have read where simm cards could be an issue so i removed the 4 x 4gb cards and they are clean. Blew out any dust in and around cpu. Even replaced the cr2023 on board battery. Also verified the monitor worked on another computer. 

Am i missing something? Any other suggestions?

How to Remove Power Throttle Limit on Dell 7577
"So i'm trying to solve this issue for like a few months. I have a Dell 7577 laptop (1050 Ti, 16 GB RAM version.) but sad part is i can not play games on it. My problem is when my CPU temperature hits 74 celcius, my CPU clock speed goes down to 0.79 GHz and because of that, my games running at 5 FPS with very laggy situation. I've tried many things to escape from this power throttle limit but i couldn't be successful about it. So i wanted to ask here. Let me type things i've tried:

\- Downgrading BIOS version to 1.9.3 (It's my current BIOS version right now.)

\- Undervolting CPU via ThrottleStop.

\- Changing ""Turbo Boost Power Max"" value to 50W from 45W in XTU.

\- Deleting ""esif \_manager.info\_amd64\_... "" and ""dptf \_acpi.inf\_amd64\_... "" folders in   ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\DriverStore\\FileRepository"" 

\- Enabling ""Speedshift"" and disabling ""Speedstep"" in ThrottleStop.

\- Ticking ""Disable and Lock Turbo Power Limits"" checkbox in FIVR section of ThrottleStop.

Please help me. I want to play games on my device but i can not because of this power limit. Please save me from this suffer.

[Dell Inspiron 5570] Getting 144hz
"**The Situation**

I have an Dell Inspiron 5570 that has an HDMI port and a Type C port that can be used for display output. I also have a Samsung 2k 144hz curved monitor that I connect my laptop to and has HDMI and DisplayPort. Currently it works at 1440p @ 60hz. I always thought that my monitor supported 144hz through DisplayPort only, so since my laptop did not have DisplayPort, so I just forgot about it and stayed at 60hz for the past 3 years. 

I recently started gaming occasionally through GeForce Now, and got curious on weather I could get 144hz somehow.

Looking around the internets, I figured out that HDMI 2.1 can actually run 1440p @ 144hz just fine, and the issue was the supplied HDMI cable that came with the monitor all along, which was not HDMI 2.1, surprise surprise. 

&#x200B;

**The Problem**

Now, I got a glimpse of hope as soon as I connected the HDMI 2.1 on my devices and saw the 144hz option light up on my display, only to be let down by Windows display settings not letting my go past 60,01hz. After a quick Google Search I saw that my iGPU has a maximum refresh rate of 75hz, but Windows do not let me get even that.

&#x200B;

**My Question**

Could a Type C to DisplayPort dongle give me 144hz for some magical reason that I would not understand? Should I buy one, and if I do, should I pay attention to something or grab the first one I see? Or is it this monitor's fate to never get fully utilized and run that sweet 144hz it was made to do?

&#x200B;

Thanks everyone, waiting to hear your thoughts!"
HDMI to DisplayPort?
"I have a bunch of dell stuff that work gave to me to work from homeâ€”most importantly for this a laptop, a docking station, a monitor, and a cable to connect the monitor to the docking station. I lost the cable and have been trying to replace it on my own, but I cannot figure out what the hell I need. The monitor has a place to insert a DisplayPort plug, and the docking station has a place to insert HDMI cables. I learned the hard way that most cables go DisplayPort to HDMI, which is the opposite of what I want. I tried to buy a converter cable but it doesnâ€™t have a male DisplayPort cable to plug into the monitor. Help?"

Iâ€™m pretty sure itâ€™s the fan whether it be bent or broke. Iâ€™m a student though I canâ€™t go without it. If the fan is damaged is it okay to use?

XPS 9710 turning off fast startup adds 1:15 to boot time
"Hi,

My XPS 9710 takes 16 seconds to boot up from the point I turn it on to my desktop. I turned off fast startup with the understanding that due to using an SSD, this should add at most a few seconds. However, startup now takes 1:45 seconds. I've tested this several times and am not sure why such a significant difference exists. Bios time is similar in both cases (8.2 seconds). Windows and all drivers are up to date (via Dell Command). Any ideas what could be wrong?"
Has Dell ever shipped a laptop with a sticker like this on their hard drive? Did my un
"My 80 year old uncle bought  a Dell Inspirion 15 laptop brand new about 5 or 6 years ago and recently it wouldn't work.  I don't know what the extent of the issue was but he said he took it to a local computer shop to see how much they would charge to fix it. They had it for a day and said it was $200 to fix.  My uncle thought it was too much and brought it back home.He asked me to take a look at it.  Did the diagnostics and said hard drive was missing or undetected.  I opened it up and saw the small and flat hard drive ribbon cable for the 2.5inch HDD detached from the mother board connector.  The latch on the connector was in the lock position and no signs of pulling damage or bends on the ribbion or it's locking fins. I plugged it back in and started the laptop and there was no boot disk, Ran the built in diagnostics again and it gave a hard drive error 2000-0142,  validation 106315.What I'm wondering is if the shop might have replaced the original hard drive with this broken one and left it unplugged on purpose to scam him? There was pry marks on the keyboard so I know they most likely opened it up.  (You have to remove the keypboard to get to remove the back cover.)  My uncle nor anyone in the house would ever think to pry the keyboard off.  Plust the ribbon being detached, there's no way it could become detached like that with any kind of dropping or even slamming the laptop without major damage. Plus with this sticker on the drive it got me very suspicious of the shop. The sticker is faced down so you have to actually remove the drive to see it, so maybe they slipped up thinking my uncle would every get that far to see it.

Anyhow after making sure the ribbon cable was snugged again with the same error, I ordered a new hard drive to replace it, hopefully it's not the ribbon cable.

XPS 15 9570 crashes/reboots when locked
"Hey folks, like the title says - have a strange thing happening with my xps when I leave it idle.

When I'm actively using the machine I very rarely experience any crashes, maybe 2 BSOD's in the past year. I can be on it all day with no issue. However, if I step away and leave it idle it *almost always* has rebooted when I return (all apps closed, and when I launch my browser I get the ""chrome didn't shut down correctly, want to restore your session?"" message)

It's a bit tough to troubleshoot as it only happens when I'm away from it, and by the time I'm back it has already rebooted. I don't use this machine for anything critical so it's not a huge deal, just annoying enough that I want to fix it but not so annoying I want to do a clean windows install.

I've tried changing all behaviors in power settings to no avail, the machine shouldn't be going to sleep while docked so I don't think it's a c-states thing.

Just wondering if anyone else has had/fixed this problem with theirs?

It's on windows 11, and this has been happening for \~6 months now."

Battery replacement for Dell Inspiron 3138 not working... it beeps 5 times whenever I try to plug it in with charger connected.
"I have tried to ground it and to plug and plug it a couple of times.

The replacement battery is of a slightly voltage.

Original battery: 11.1 V
New Battery: 11.4 VW

The battery spent some time traveling due to me living outside of the US, so it _may_ be discharged.

It may also be that the motherboard is incompatible with it as I've noticed that this exact same model has version with a fanâ€”which I imagine why there's a version of the same battery that uses 11.4 V.

Right now I have it charging and will try to turn on the laptop.

Precision 5470 i9 12900H with Liquid Metal
"Specs:

Intel Core i9-12900H

RTX A1000 4GB

On a 10 minute Cinebench R23 run, was getting around 13,000 MC and 1,700 SC. Don't have exact numbers but there's plenty of reviews where they run Cinebench on this laptop and those are around the numbers they get with this configuration too.

After applying liquid metal, installing a custom-built Windows 11 ISO made to be super minimal with NTLite, disabling Spectre and Meltdown mitigations, and setting laptop to Ultra Performance in the BIOS, seeing about 2500 pt increase in MC and 200 pt increase for SC.

Seems like these models are making their way to eBay now, I got mine for only $1700 (the seller I got it from still looks to have 1 available at this price that's the same specs). At that price this is a great deal when it comes to getting the most CPU performance you can get out of a 14 inch laptop.

Brand new Dell keeps hanging on the wake up screen
"Got a new Dell laptop for Christmas (G15 Gaming Laptop) and so far I am enjoying it. However, sometimes when I let it go to sleep, it won't wake back up. It starts to, but then the log in screen never appears.  So, it will be black screen/asleep, I'll jiggle the mouse or hit some keys and the random image will load (like landscape or whatever they rotate through). Usually then a little log in screen appears for me to put in my password.  Sometimes though, that screen never appears. The clock doesn't appear. It's JUST the landscape. Nothing I do can make it display the password/log in. I end up having to hold down the power button. Then it lets me ""Slide to shut down"" the computer.

I went in and already removed the password requirement, thinking that would solve the issue, but it still makes me press ""sign in"" button to get to the desktop, and THAT never pops up.

This is a brand new machine with almost nothing on it. Why is this happening? How do I fix it?"

Latitude 7400 2-in-1 USB-C data transfer rate is only 28MB per second. While same SSD in the USB 3.0 port is as expected at 250MB per second. The cable used is USB-C from SSD to USBA to laptop. Then I used a USB-A to USB-C adaptor. What's going on here?
"Everything is up to date in the Dell Command Update.   Am I missing the proper controllers or something?I used a 100w USBC to USBC cable and still the same super slow speed. So it's not the cable.

My Storage hard disk drive with that USBA - to C adaptor gets 38MB/s lol faster than the  M.2 enclosure!   And USBA it only gets 75MB/s much slower than the M.2 enclosure at 250MB/s so that's normal.

UPDATE - SOLVED Sort of.I think I figured it out. I have two USB-C ports, both marked with a lightning bolt but one is also marked as the laptop battery charging port. Seems like the one marked for charging is the slow one. The other was occupied so I didn't test it assuming they should be the same. But that one is gettinng 280MB/s. So they are different apparently. At least one is fast, thats better than neither.  


UPDATE #2 - Tested another exact same model, same cpu, same memory, but cleaner install. I got 378MB/s  on both ports!  So something is not right with mine. "

Serious Issue with myInspiron 15 3567
" For almost 2 years now I have a serious performance problem with my Inspiron 15 3567 laptop that I cannot solve.

The problem is that the screen flickers for milliseconds, every 2 seconds, but the strange thing is that it also distorts the audio along with the screen (it makes a strange sound like a distortion, and it's not with any special audio). 

I tried connecting the laptop to the TV to see if it was a screen issue, but the same thing happens. I updated my drivers, although there are some that crash my laptop setting it on eternal loading screen, in particular Intel Rapid Storage Technology Driver and Managment Console, and I had to format it a couple of times, but nothing.

DELL Optiplex 990 doesnâ€™t detect memory modules
"Hello Reddit,

A few months ago, my mother bought a used Optiplex 990 for work. It was working pretty fine until we move to our new house and it doesnâ€™t work anymore. The 1 and 3 lights were on but I donâ€™t remember about the power button. We called some technician to help fixing the Desktop but he said he canâ€™t fix it so we abandoned it for a while.

Fast forward to 4 months later, I decided to take it out and fix it again. First thing I did was removing the RAM sticks and place it back again, then I remove the circle battery near the CPU slots and finally turn it on. When I turn it on thereâ€™s only the number 1 light on and the power button switch to blue (image) with a few beeps.

Iâ€™m not a really techy guy and Iâ€™m stuck at this part so it would be great if someone could help me out, thanks.

"""No hdmi signal from your device"" screen on all the time"
"Hello,

&#x200B;

I bought a Dell monitor and I use to connect my laptop there so I work on my monitor when at home via HDMI cable,  but however the screen displaying, ""No hdmi signal from your device"", is on all the time when my laptop is not connected. Would this hurt my monitor by any chance? 

&#x200B;

Thanks!

PS - Is there a way to fully shutoff my monitor completely."
Black Screen after installing new SSD Card Latitude 5320 laptop
"I purchased a refurbished Dell Latitude 5320, and a Samsung SSD980 NvMe M.2.   

As soon as I got it, it powered up and I was able to put Windows 10 on a bootable disk.  

I then powered down, disconnected the battery, grounded myself and the computer, and then installed the new SSD.  

When I power on, the keyboard lights up and the fan runs, but the screen remains black.  

I press F2 on start up. (Stupid question: the F2 key is volume down primary and F2 when holding the'fn' key. Do I need to hold the fn key when I am trying to enter BIOS?)  

Can't get to a BIOS screen, tried replacing with the original SSD and still couldn't.  


Anyone know what else I can do? Did I somehow ruin my new laptop?"

XPS 8940 disable RST to install Linux as dual boot
"As a follow-up to this post [https://www.reddit.com/r/Dell/comments/zuklk6/xps\_8940\_stuck\_at\_boot/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dell/comments/zuklk6/xps_8940_stuck_at_boot/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) , I am looking to install Arch Linux as dual boot with Windows on my XPS 8940 desktop.

The issue is that as soon as I change from RAID to AHCI in the BIOS my XPS 8940 simply stops booting. It gets stuck at DELL logo while booting normally, if F2 is pressed it says ""Loading BIOS menu"" and stops there and if F12 is pressed it say "" Loading boot menu"" and stops there.

"I have a Dell Xps 13 9310 laptop and the stupid thing only has two usb c ports! nothing more than that.... but I suspect most companies are going this route bug idk of course. any between all the annoying dongles and adapters, the freakin usb c ports have gotten all loose and usb sticks fall out sometimes partially sometimes all the way. it's so difficult to use anything that requires usb c now. I mean I can obviously have the ports changed, but then I would have to keep doing so. Any idea to help alleviate this some? is this common with dell laptops? thanks"
Old Dell wonâ€™t boot any OS.
"My uncle bought back in 2011 a Dell Inspiron N7110 made in May of 2010. He gave it to me today because he didnâ€™t need it. The laptop came with windows 7 pre installed but he had upgraded all the way to windows 10. The first thing I did, after I got the laptop and backed up his data in case he needs them in the feature, was to install fedora 37 (my OS of choice). Trying to boot the USB resulted in an error message saying â€œOperation system not foundâ€. After trying changing some BIOS settings, I decided to try the same but this time burning the ISO with rufus using ISO mode. It booted and installed just fine. Rebooting the computer resulted in the same error message, this time booting from the internal hard drive.

I have tried 8 different Linux distros and windows 10 but everything resulted in the same issue.

I also tried updating the BIOS from A08 to A13 using FreeDOS.

What I find interesting is that the computer wonâ€™t boot and give this error message every time unless Iâ€™ve created the USB using Rufus.

Any ideas? Iâ€™ve already changed a ton of BIOS settings, used different USB flash drives, used different ports.

Thank you in advance!"

When I try to install Windows Server 2022 it says it can not see the disks. I tried loading the drivers from Windows 2016 and that did not work. Does anyone know of a solution to install 2022 on a R730XD?

"If HDMI is not working, check this (worked on my xps plus 9320)"
" I was getting various not-working to half-working (half squished screen) display results on my monitor\* via HDMI, trying various HDMI-to-usb-c adapters/hubs on my xps 13 plus. My monitor is the Samsung ultrawide g9 --so maybe less of an issue for those with a smaller, less demanding monitor. Anyhow, what finally worked for me was changing the refresh rate from 60Hz to 59.98Hz (yours could be 59.94Hz) in the Windows Display->Advanced Display settings. I knew the refresh rate was there but I would have naturally ignored the very similar refresh rate as the thing to try.

&#x200B;

Hopefully if someone has similar issue it saves them from trying different graphics adapter drivers and monitor settings."

Dell Inspiron refuses charging after it died
"This is the 4th time this happened. When my Dell Inspirion dies, it will not accept the 65W charger until I do some stuff like BIOS reset, charge the computer with a lower wattage etc, and I'll need to use a phone charger on USB-C to charge it until it charges well and I'm able to fix the issue. Oh and currently it refuses to recognise any charger when the machine is on. I done a BIOS diagnostics which reports 'Charger is not detected' when the 65W charger is on. I know that the 65W USB-C charger isn't the issue because it charges my other devices and the led indicator is on when it's plugged in. If I plug in my phone charger BIOS reports the charger as plugged in and gives me warnings of not enough power, may won't be able to charge battery yada yada. Does anyone know why this happens and how to fix it? Thank youP.S. I can't really remove the battery from my computer due to other reasons, so that won't be an option"

New Dell G15 shut down instantly when plugged into a wall outlet and will not turn back on.
"The issue started last week. I unplugged the charger to move the laptop somewhere else and I plugged it back in and it shut off. I turned it back on after. Today I plugged it back in while it was on and it just instantly shut off and now it won't even turn on.


The plugged in indicator light on the back of the laptop doesn't light up anymore. Pressing the power button does nothing.

I've tried unplugging it and pressing the power button but it didn't work. 

I did not take the battery out because my dad is afraid it will void the warranty if I try to take out the battery and try plugging it in then.

Dell just lost my Monitor
"I ordered a 34â€ 1440p 144hz monitor from dell directly on 26th Dec, My work monitor died and this was a replacement so I requested one of the Dell customer service representative to expedite the package and they said they will do it. 

My order was shipped on Dec 30. Now When I go to check my order status It shows up as delivered on December 9, Few weeks before I even placed an order and that too in entirety different province. 

I contacted customer service and asked them whatâ€™s going on and they told me that theyâ€™re looking for it. This was 5 days ago. Every singe day I ask customer support if they have any update and all I get is that weâ€™ve assigned a case specialist and they will contact you (no one does), they ask for 1 day and they provide me with an update and guess what? I never hear from them again.

Now Iâ€™m losing money everyday not being able to work because of a dead monitor (I agree, itâ€™s not dellâ€™s fault my monitor died) and lack of communication from Dell because all of their support staff is just filled with idiots.

UPDATE - Dell has decided to send me a Replacement for the unit and it should ship out within a week. Letâ€™s hope this one arrives home safe."

"I had gotten a retired e4310 from a friend's office and had noticed one single issue with it. The time between the dell logo and the OS beginning to load takes roughly a minute. Just sits on a black screen with nothing happening for about a minute before anything happens. 

It does it with operating systems in UEFI or legacy mode, the OS itself doesn't change anything about the time it takes since it happens before the OS even initializes (no HDD/SSD and it still sits on that black screen), even getting to the F12 menu after the dell logo takes that amount of time, memory speed or amount don't change anything about the time it takes, turning on quick boot causes it to get stuck on that black screen indefinitely, and lastly, there is nothing out of the usual in the system logs section of the bios and the system diag F12 selection doesn't find any issues with the system.

I've tried restoring system defaults, clearing cmos and replacing the battery, changing out memory with a plethora of sticks and configs, etc and nothing has worked so far.

I really emphasize the OS since most of trying to search for it just brings up people having general slow boot times, so the solution is just to lower system boot tasks or SSD, but this long screen is unrelated from the OS itself. I'm also certain it has nothing to do with the age of the system since I'm typing this on a T410 from the same era that takes 1/4 the time to fully boot.

Anyone have any experience with something like this or have any suggestions?"
HP Laptop 17-ak0xx 17.3 Inch!!!!!!!!!AMAZING CONDITION!!!!!!
Has dell fixed their audio driver issues with newer laptops? Are the G15 laptops passible?
"My last Dell was an XPS15 from 2018/2019 wherein Dell crapped out the unit with a number of bugs, one of which caused the audio to go to garbage (crackle/pops). Well Dell is now apparently one of the few who doesn't have massive lead times on their laptops, so I'm looking at the G15 series of laptop. I am not a gamer, so those features are lost on me. If the laptop suffers from those same problems, I'll want to pass. 

&#x200B;

We already know Dell's support is non-existent, so I'm looking at this as WYSIWYG."
Inspiron 5402 making weird buzzing sound.
I got this laptop 3 years ago and upgraded it. Gave it 16GB more ram and 1TB of ssd and worked fine. I clean the fan every 6 months and keep it on a wooden desk most of the time. This clicking appeared about a year ago and I thought nothing of it because it only makes the noise when the fan is off and it is very quiet. Just want to make sure it wonâ€™t just combust out of nowhere. It is using an intel core i3 1115g4.
New laptop issues and the hurdles I am being forced over to repair
"From the initial response to the latest, these are the steps I have had to follow for a laptop that is crashing daily. (randomly hangs with black screen and full fan speed, only a hard reset with holding power for 30s works ) Note that over the past 2 weeks, I have had multiple EUC engineers assist with remote diagnosis and updates in response to Dell, as I don't have any admin rights myself.

This laptop was a brand new replacement by Dell in response to my last one which fried its own USB PD port:

# First set of questions/instructions:

# 6th response to my feedback that the laptop was COMPLETELY reset to factory and wiped with a fresh OS install, and yes it still hangs:

we still have to identify the root cause that's causing this crashing issue as system replacement is not applicable at this point.

Or if you want, you can send this system to our depot center. The depot technician will need to personally diagnose the computer to make sure all necessary parts are replaced and ensure full system functionality. The system will be brought to our repair facility where our technicians will test the system in detail and replace any defective hardware needed to fix the problem.

The system will be collected and will be delivered back after 5 business days. All costs for pickup/delivery and repair are covered by Dell Service (warranty). Would you like me to go ahead and book for the collection?

Are you able to use your own box for the collection? I can schedule it on Friday."
Dell Inspiron 14 5406 2-in-1
My fans sound like its vibrating and its uncessarily hot and it sounds so unpleasant and it literally is so loud even when its not doing anything. It won't stop even thought its on sleep. I can feel the vibrations when im typing and it souds the fans get louder and quiter and do the same thing in the span of a few seconds and keep doing it. I have to manually turn the fans off sometimes because they're loud. Is there a fix? Should I replace my fans? i dont think its dust because I've only had it for like 8 months and I keep it clean.

Docking Station Woes
"I'm helping someone troubleshoot some strange issues with their WD19TBS docking station and Dell XPS 15 9520. They primarily use the docking station while using the laptop, but this week decided to work from a new location. They tried using the charger that came with the laptop but it wasn't providing a charge. They decided to just go back to the docking station since the laptop was about to die, but received a battery notification from Windows stating ""Slow Charger: To speed up charging, use the charger that came with the device.

I confirmed the user is using the 180w power supply that came with the WD19TBS and I also confirmed they're using the Thunderbolt ports rather than the USB-C ports. We have attempted installing just about every driver I could find for this model laptop and docking station.

Looking for some direction on what could be causing this issue.

Side note: The user also mentioned the 2 HP 27er monitors they use with the docking station are randomly flickering throughout the day. This could be related to an overall docking station issue, but not 100% sure about that."
How easy is it to replace the Dell Latitude e7450 screen to 1920x1080? Is it better than the 1366x768 one?
"I have a Dell Latitude e7450 and i really like how easy to access the internals for upgrades, which is something I really miss on laptops nowadays. I really like this as a work horse laptop.

However, the screen on this laptop is pretty below average. I see some 1920x1080 screen replacements on ebay or amazon for the 7450. how easy is it to upgrade the screen. will it be better?

Would you just recommend upgrading to a 5490. What's the difference between the build quality on these devices. They seem to look the same at first glance."
Dell M6800 cpu upgrade...
"Right, I've upgraded my GPU from the Firepro M6100 to a NVIDIA Tesla M6 8GB GDDR5 Maxwell 2.0 MXM 3.1 graphics card.

Temps are really good under load, never going above 72 degrees.

I've also ugpraded the RAM to 16GB, installed a 1TB SSD and a 256GB mSATA.

The bottleneck now is the i5 4210m and I'm fannying about which i7 to upgrade to.

Obviously the dual core i7's are out but with the heatsink for both the GPU and CPU sharing the left hand side fan, is jumping from a 37w to 47w CPU going to cause heat issues and thermal throttling?

I can grab either an i7 4800mq 2.7ghz 47w or a i7 4702mq 2.2ghz 37w.

I did have a look at the extreme processors but at 57w, that would just turn the whole thing into a fiery shit show.

P.S - Forgot to add that the 16GB RAM isn't being detected by the laptop, its something those clowns at Dell have done to the m6800.

Only two out of the four banks work with an i5 but the processor is capable of using 32GB."

First PC
Soooo Iâ€™m buying my first pc and my budget isnâ€™t that big I was think of getting the i7 core Dell OptiPlex 990 SFF but after reading and getting more info apparently it isnâ€™t very upgradable when it comes to graphics? It may need a new power supply?? Iâ€™m not well-versed in the technical jargon but I need to know should I even get the box if I want to play newer pc games? Is there another cheap pc that may give more wiggle room for upgrading or will have better cpu/gpu specs? The current price Iâ€™m would pay for the Dell OptiPlex 990 SFF is like $240. What can I do to run things like cod or league on the Dell OptiPlex 990 SFF if purchased?

"I'm 99.9% sure what's happening is right when Windows loads a certain driver, something happens, and it freezes, requiring me to force shutdown. It does not do this in Safe Mode, no the BIOS, only once I sign into Windows. I ran the Pre-Boot Dell Diagnostics, and everything came up fine.

Since it's either a device or driver, how would I go about finding out what device/driver is causing this?"

No Vega GPU in Dell XPS 15 2-in-1 9575
"I love my XPS 15 9575 but it constantly has something broken lately. The last time, the laptop was broken to the point where it would not even boot. I got it repaired through support but not even a month later, it started to constantly get BSOD and I contacted support again but for some reason, my case got closed without me knowing. Now, my laptop is out of warranty and it does not recognize my GPU and it randomly freezes. I have never had things like this happen before my SSD and whole laptop broke.

If anyone knows how to resurrect my Radeon Vega GPU, I would be very grateful as I really enjoy using this laptop thanks to the great battery life and Wacom pen support! :)

How to troubleshoot Thunderbolt dock not charging?
"I have a TB16 dock, which has worked well, aside from not being able to update the drivers. Just the other day, I noticed it's no longer charging my laptop. I have the highest wattage charger, and I haven't updated anything aside from normal monthly Windows system updates.

What's a good place to start with figuring out why it's not charging my laptop any more?

I have a Latitude 5520."
Dell G3 15 upgrade
"Hello, I want to upgrade the ram and Harddrive in my Dell G3 for video-editing.

I was going to get two sticks of crucial 16gb ddr4 3200 ram to bring the ram from 8gb to 32gb

and I was going to get a crucial 1tb BX500.

I'm pretty confident these are compatible with my laptop but I just wanted to double check (The dell website says the maximum ram the laptop can run is 16gb of 2933mhz ram but I've heard elsewhere that the dell maximum specs dont matter)

Thanks,"
Dell INsprion 14 1 year disasters
Totally frustrated here.  My Dell laptop's wireless card began failing 1 month before the warranty ran out.  I spent 1 day on the phone with India before they decided to have it sent in to Houston for replacement of the wireless card and re-install of Windows 11.  I got it back last night and now I have an error message stating that a driver can not load. I'm very frustrated because I don't want to spend more time on the line with India/Philippines.  Wish I could complain to someone in the US and let them know how bad this time suck is!
Dell Document Hub Workaround
"I wanted to post this directly on the dell website but i have to wait a day or two for the verification email unforunately.  To make a long story short i have the H815DW Dell Printer. It worked perfect as long as ive had it, this month i bought a new PC (Also dell) and i was able to get the printer drivers working fine, but i could not get the scan to computer working again.  This was very frustrating, especially since i kept the same PC files and even PC name so i would have no issues in the transition.  So then i found out dell document hub was discontinued last year, so out of frustration i called dell was on the phone for 2 hours, but they were unable to get me the Dell Document hub to fix this.  It was super frustrating, but my old PC is still able to scan.  I even switched PCs and it worked just fine. I noticed when it scans, that on the PC a display comes up saying ""H815DW Twain Driver"".  So i went back to the dell site for my printer, and downloaded just the scanner files.  I didnt think this would be neccessary as i installed the full program first.  But upon downloading the driver, the ""scan to PC"" from my printer is now working 100% again!.  I havent found anyone on the Dell site find a solution so i thought this was key.  I would imagine it would be impossible to set up a new Dell printer that wasnt configured prior to the Dell Document hub being deactivated.  But at least this gives hope to people moving to a new PC, it is definitely possible.  Also all the settings still work, i can still pick the feeder, or 2 page scans, etc. from the printer itself.  Hopefully this helps someone out there, as there was zero positive news on the web, i was very very close to giving up."

Dell Command Update - Install broke audio- is this expected?
"Background- all machines are running DCU 4.7.1.  We have our system setup to:

\- Check for updates daily at 12:30pm

\- Download and Install Updates

\- Defer reboot 3 times, 24 hours in between

&#x200B;

What appears to have happened was a user had a new audio driver download/install on 1/3/2023.  Yesterday, 1/4/23, they pinged me and alerted me that their PC audio just stopped recognizing their laptop speakers...

I connected and saw the audio icon with red X and it said not audio devices could be detected (For speaker).

Rebooting solved problem.

My question is- does Dell Command Update downloading AND INSTALLING drivers cause this issue?  I am struggling to believe that is it as it downloaded on 1/3 but it was reported on 1/4. 

I would expect it would not take a installed/working driver offline until a reboot...

Anyone else experience anything like this?"
Dell's broken hinge problem
"Why have DELL not fixed their hinge issue? We have 18 laptops purchased over the last 14 months and all of them have had to be repaired - the most recent is only 8 weeks old.

A google search shows this has been going on for at least 3-4 years and it's a widespread problem.

Why are they still churning them out this way?

Thankfully in the UK they are honouring repairs, even outside of warranty because ""it's a long standing known issue"" but I understand in America they are more reluctant."

Getting black screen after display driver update
"I have xps 13 9350 with intel HD 520 graphics. It was working fine but suddenly after a restart it got black screen. Tried win + ctrl + shift + B but it didn't fix. So i had no choice and reinstalled fresh window 10 from USB. It seemed to work fine until it updated the display driver and then screen went complete black again. It's not powered off, i can hear system sounds when i press random keys. So i went to safe mode and uninstalled display driver. Restarted again and then it worked! 100% display driver issue. Anyone else seen this before? I can't find anything like this online. Can this be hardware problem or just screwed up driver from microsoft/intel?"

Laptop performance issues
" Firstly, forgive my english beacuse i'm quite stressed with the situation.

I've got a alienware M15 recently (I7 from 11th gen, 3070, 16GB Ram). It's battery unloads while plugged into the outlet when i'm gaming (games not that demanding, like fortnite or even CSGO and Valorant). Like it's not enough, the frame rate drops substantially every 2 or 3 minutes, causing the game to crash for about half a second.

Could anybody help me please? It's been a while since i'm having these problems and i just do not know what to do about it or how to fix (or if it is possible to fix)."

Dell XPS 15 9500 left RAM slot malfunctioning when bottom lid is on
"Hey everyone,

I am asking for as much advice as I can get about this issue so I could possibly avoid sending my laptop to Dell. Anyways, I was using my laptop as usual a few weeks ago when, all of a sudden, everything froze. Upon forcing the turn off and trying to reboot, the error code on the charging indicator flashed a RAM error. I ordered a new RAM stick and tested the two 16GB sticks I have, but both of them and the new RAM were not the issue. Turns out, installing RAM in the left RAM slot (when looking up towards the fans) worked fine until I put the bottom lid back on, at which I heard faint electrical buzzing and got screen artifacts/freezing and the RAM error code. Sometimes it would work with the lid on but freeze when I touched down on the lid (didn't press very hard). I'm unsure of what contact is being made or what went wrong given the cause of my issues is not obvious. Can anyone offer advice or at least confirm that I should sent this laptop to Dell for fixing?

Thanks y'all

\-Charles"
Dell Inspiron 16 2-in-1 Touchpad Glitching
"I have had my Dell laptop for 4 months now, and for the past 2 months, I have noticed that the touchpad would get glitchy from time to time (freezing, erratic behavior, etc.). Recently, the problem has worsened to the point that I have to always connect my Bluetooth mouse. Is anyone else experiencing the same problem?"
"If I could go back, I would not have gone with a Dell lap top"
"I  received my XPS 15 9520 in late July. Since just about day one of  running it, almost every time I booted it up I would get the Support  Assist screen saying it was testing the processing fans. A month later, I  began my semester in a pretty demanding program, and simply didn't have  the time to deep dive into the issue. I also ended up using the  computers on campus, as they were optimized for my study activities.

When  I did use the laptop over the fall semester, it performed ok at best;  the keyboard would often get really hot, the fan would randomly start  spinning quite loudly, and it sometimes would be quite stubborn when I  was trying to boot it up (wouldn't turn on on the first try, etc...).  SO, when the semester ended, I got in touch with Dell. First they had me  run diagnostics over the phone, and when those failed to resolve the  issue, they sent a tech to replace the fans.

The  new fans made a difference... for a day. And then out of nowhere I  started getting blue screen errors, with different error messages each  time. Again, I called Premium Support, and again, they had me run  diagnostics as well as remote accessed the laptop to run more tests.  These phone calls ended up being around 2 hours each time.

The  issues persisted, so we got to the point where the tech wanted me to  backup my files so we could do a reinstall of Windows. Upon reinstalling  Windows, the laptop would not recognize any wifi networks, and after  some poking around the tech realized it was because the wifi drivers  needed to be reinstalled. He said he would email them to me so I could  load them onto a flash drive and then transfer them to the laptop. This  would about 3 hours into the phone call.

At  that point, I thanked him for his help but explained that these calls  were taking up way too much time (I'd sunk about 12 hours into dealing  with tech support up until then), and asked to speak to a manager about a  replacement or refund because I don't have endless hours to be on the  phone with tech support, especially as nothing they had done had  resolved the issue.

I spoke with  several supervisors, and just got off the phone today with a customer  service rep from their ""corporate"" team, and they all said the same  thing: a) technical issues happen with computers, b) you should have  called sooner, its past 30 days so a refund or replacement is  impossible, and c) they can send a tech to come fix it.

All  in all, a pretty crappy experience, both in terms of customer service  and in the performance of the laptop. If anyones considering a Dell product, I would advise looking elsewhere.

Dell WD19 K20A and Latitude 5400 - 4k 60Hz Compatability
"I recently bought a lightly used Dell WD19 (K20A001 1887B MHG64 to be exact) from eBay for my home office. I knew from reading Dell's resolution guide that I can't connect two 4k monitors at the same time, let alone at 60Hz. I was surprised to find, however, that my work Latitude 5400 will not output 4k 60Hz through the dock (it's stuck at 30Hz). I was equally surprised when I plugged in my 2020 Macbook Pro (M1) and 4k 60Hz works flawlessly (in fact, MacOS reports that it's outputting 5k but scaling to 4k).

Would anyone know the reason why this is happening? I assume it may have to do with HBR2/HBR3. I can plug in a DP-USB-C connector to the Dell laptop and it will run fine at 4k, 60Hz... just not through the dock."
Issues undervolting XPS 15 9570
"Hello, I have noticed that despite repasting, cleaning, etc. my XPS 15 9570 (8750H) runs relatively hot (idling high 40s, with the processor pulling 12-15W at idle), which is making battery life worse, etc. I decided to undervolt it by reverting bios settings to factory, then applying whatever changes I needed in ThrottleStop. This seemed to work great, decreasing the power at idle to less than 1W at times and the temperature to the high 30s. The issue is that whenever I restart or boot up my computer, the changes donâ€™t stay. According to ThrottleStop, the voltage offset is still there, but the thermals and power usage revert back to being mediocre. Does anybody know a possible solution to this? Any help would be greatly appreciated. My bios version is 1.2."

Docking station and gaming limitations? XPS 15 9150 w/ 3050 Ti and WD19S
"I currently have an XPS 15 9150 w/ i7, 16gb RAM, and 3050 Ti. I use a WD19S docking station. I have two external monitors hooked up to the dock via DisplayPort (1080p 75hz monitors). I play games on one of the two external monitors. Use the other two monitors for basic things while gaming (like web browser and discord). 

My question is whether I'm putting myself at a performance disadvantage? I've read online that the 3050 ti doesn't actually work when external monitors are hooked up? Or maybe the docking station should be a thunderbolt (e.g., the WD22TB4)?

I ask because I occasionally play games that should easily run with my laptops specs (like Destiny 2) but experience screen tearing. No matter what settings I change (vSync, etc.) the screen tearing doesn't go away. But when I play Destiny 2 ONLY on the laptop (not hooked up to the dock), screen tearing is much less frequent or nonexistent."

My horrible repair experience with Dell
"I wanted to share my recent experience getting my brand new $5000 Dell 7670 laptop repaired.

**Why would I have to have a brand new laptop repaired?** ***Because*** **dude, I got a Dell.**

It all started almost two months ago when my new laptop 7670 arrived. I work at a small startup as a software engineer. We make 3D graphics software, and my current development machine, a Core i7-6700K / NVIDIA GTX 1080 based desktop, had been feeling pretty long in the tooth, both for compile times as well as GPU performance. 

I so excited to have the i9-12850HX and RTX A4500 powered system to make quick work of my application's compile time, and all of this power in a laptop form-factor meant I could easily bring my dev machine on the road as I travel a lot.

I quickly set up my dev environment, and got our application compiled. To my great surprise, it ran like total crap. Our application can take advantage of as many CPU cores as you can throw at it, as well as make great use of the GPU for offloading work. However, it ran slower on the 7670 with its 16 cores / 24 threads than it did on my old desktop which had 4 cores / 8 threads, and a GPU from 2016.

I looked at the task manager and saw that the machine would throttle itself down significantly after \~2 seconds of intense work. the CPU would go from a blazing fast 4.8GHz at first and wind up as low as **800Mhz** after a few seconds. It would stay at this throttled level until I stopped the program from doing its thing. The program was practically unusable in this state, and I was flabbergasted.

After a bit of searching I found that a setting in a Dell Optimizer utility had to be changed to allow the laptop to actually use its CPU for much of anything without it having a nervous breakdown.

After that, and some other tweaking and customizing, I was a pretty happy camper, enjoying my new speedy compile times and fast modern GPU.

**The honeymoon ends**

I went on a trip to Vegas for a month and brought the laptop with me. Everything was going fine for about a week, when one day before lunch, a Dell utility popped up a notification about a BIOS update. 

""Perfect timing"" I thought, ""I'll start the BIOS update, have lunch and it will be updated by the time I am done.""

When I got back from lunch, I tapped the keyboard to wake the laptop and nothing happened. I tried the power button in case it had just turned itself off instead of rebooting after the update. Nothing still. I then noticed that the white LED ring on the power cable was not lit, even though the power was plugged into the wall, and was definitely lit when I left. I unplugged the power adapter and plugged it back in exactly the same way and the LED came back on. Strange.

The laptop was completely unresponsive. I tried all of the ""reset"" sequences I could find online and in the user manual for the laptop. Eventually I found that in order to reset the BIOS I would need to completely disassemble the laptop to get at the small coin cell hidden somewhere underneath the motherboard. I would literally have to take apart my brand new laptop, remove all components, including the CPU/GPU heatsinks to get at it.

I was at an AirBnB in Vegas without any proper equipment to do a repair like this, and quite frankly I was pissed that the laptop bricked itself, and did not want to spend an entire day inside the laptop's guts, so I thought better of it.

I figured it should be a pretty simple repair for someone who is trained and does this for a living, I decided to leave this to the professionals at Dell and I requested a box to ship it out. How long could it take? I had a month in Vegas and I wanted my laptop so I could get some work done.

**The descent into madness**

This is where things started to go south. I got a call from FedEx saying they could not deliver the return box because they were missing a unit number. I ***know*** I put in the unit number, because when ordering the return box, it tried to auto correct the address, and *removed the unit number*. I distinctly remember *not* accepting its ""corrected"" address, because it was F\*in wrong!

After I received the box a few days later, I thought I should ask the fine folks at Dell if they'd be able to return the repaired laptop to my office in NYC in case the repairs would take longer than I was going to be in Vegas for, and because they had already messed up the Vegas address, so I was starting to not trust them. I started a chat with a support agent and he assured said he would send me an email, and if I replied to it with the address of my office, that it would be no problem. I replied to the email and asked the agent if he received it and could confirm it for me. He said he hadn't received it yet, but assured me I would get a response from my case owner soon.

A few days went by and I had received **NO** response whatsoever from anyone at Dell. I was not confident in shipping out the laptop for repairs without confirmation that it would go where I requested. I emailed them another two times and went several more days without a response. I know that these emails were logged in their system because they showed up in the Dell support center dashboard. I even initiated a message from within the support dashboard, hoping it might notify someone in a different way. Still no response.

I finally sent the system in after I got an email from Dell saying that they were about to cancel the repair if I didn't send it in soon. I figured there would be no way they would repair the system without looking at any of my messages, so I took a risk and sent it in.

**Incompetence... utter incompetence.**

After a few days I saw some automated messages stating that they had received my laptop and were going to start diagnosing it soon. Yay.

Several more days go by and I get an automated update that a part needed for repairs is on back-order and will cause a delay.

Another day goes by and I get an email from an *actual human being* telling me about the parts backlog, and asking me if I would like to wait for the parts, or do a system exchange.

Not knowing which of these options would result in me having a working laptop soonest, I inquired. I also took the opportunity to ask if he could confirm that my system would actually be returned to the NYC address I had provided several times before.

The Dell rep responded confirmed that yes the system would be returned to the address I provided. ***Hallelujah!*** I had my confirmation at last!

He then clarified that the parts delay should be resolved in about 3 days, and that a system exchange would take up to 45 days.

...WAIT WHAT?! Why are you even offering a system exchange if it would result in a LONGER delay? Are you effing kidding me? This makes no sense at all.

I responded, stating as much, and that I would be happy to wait for the repair, and thanked him for confirming the return address for me.

Weeks go by with an automated update here or there saying that they have a part, then they don't have a part, and there's another delay.

Finally, one day about 3 weeks ago I get an email that my repair is complete! And the system is shipping out soon and I'll get a tracking number shortly.

The next day I get an automated response saying that it has been shipped, FINALLY. It will be arriving in Vegas in a few days!

WAIT, VEGAS!? And to the address without a unit number!? For F's sake... OF COURSE they messed that up.

The next morning, Friday, I call them and explain the situation. The rep says that they have to talk to many different people because of how big of a mess this situation is. They say they will be getting the package re-routed to the address in NYC and that I should get a new tracking number by Monday.

Monday comes around, with no update. Tuesday, same thing. This is now the week between Christmas  and New Years, so I expect shipping to be crazy. I check the original tracking number and it says delayed, but still doesn't say anything about it being re-routed.

Finally, this past Monday, I get an automated email from Dell saying that my laptop has been returned to them because they could not deliver it, and it says ***I need to respond to that email with a valid address*** and they'll get it shipped out. Are you serious!? Maybe use the address I emailed and called about at least 7 times!? I am beyond furious at this point. I have never been so routinely ignored by a customer support in my life.

I call them again and explain the situation again, and at least this time the rep is as aghast with the situation as I am, and apologizes for how I have been treated. I will say this rep was great, and really made me feel like he cared. He immediately said he was bringing in his supervisor on this and it would get taken care of ASAP. Of course I just had to take his word for it, but I did trust this guy.

Two days later, with no further emails or updates from Dell, no tracking or anything, someone at the NYC office tells me they have received the package. Amazing.

I had to get the laptop overnighted to me as I was out of town again, and I now have my laptop again FINALLY!

However, I noticed that the repair team managed to damage the bottom case cover, by what looks like they tried to pry it open with a screwdriver. I read the instruction manual and the bottom cover is actually quite simple to take off, so I am amazed that Dell's own technicians would not know how to do this properly without damaging the case.

Anyway. Thats my experience with Dell's system repair. If you made it this far, I hope it makes you think twice about purchasing from this awful company. Seriously this was such an awful experience and it is actually hard to believe they suck this much at doing their jobs. I am really in disbelief at how badly this went.

IPS vs WVA panels.
"Hi all, currently trying to buy a laptop, dell g15 exactly. But I'm looking for a Ips panel.  
Googled/searched reddit for this, some people say they're the same, some say the wva is slightly worse. 

From the dell website, the 165 hz ones are 160 degrees viewing angle vertical and horizontal. While Ips are 178. Does that mean wva are worse?

What about colours and other stuff.

Thanks all."
Dell G15 performance after fresh Windows install
"Hey guys, i bought a Dell G15 on black friday and switched from Linux to Windows 11, but with this fresh install it didn't come with any dell drivers, and I feel that it isn't on ""gaming mode"" (fans not making any noise at all, gpu and cpu not on 100% while not reaching 60% fps in Elden Ring for example), any ideas on what should I try?

I already tried downloading the drivers on the Dell G15 page, but the Alienware Command Center doesn't recognize my notebook as compatible

Dell WD19 docking station not being picked up by my PC. Any solutions?
"Tried searching online but am only getting generic ""Have you tried turning it off and back on again?"" resources, even from Dell itself.
  
I have a WD19 docking station for work and am trying to make it so that I can just switch the lightning/USB cable directly to and from my work laptop and my PC tower so as to share peripherals/desk.
  
When I plug the dock directly into my PC's motherboard, however, it doesn't seem to register.
  
Pretty much everything in my tower is *years* newer than my laptop, so while not impossible I would be shocked if it was a plain issue of my PC not supporting the dock.

Upgrading RAM myself
"Hello,

I'm speccing out a Precision 5760 for myself and I'm seeing the RAM upgrade prices and am completely taken aback. To go from the minimum 1x8GB non-ECC memory to 2x32GB non-ECC memory is $525.15. I can buy the same Kingston RAM sticks (with ECC) for $123.99 [here](https://www.insight.com/en_US/shop/product/KTD-PN432E%2F32G/KINGSTON/KTD-PN432E%2F32G/Kingston--DDR4--module--32-GB--SODIMM-260pin--3200-MHz--PC425600--unbuffered/). I'd be comfortable installing them myself as the RAM is easily removable (not soldered).

Is the RAM upgrade just a ripoff or am I missing something here?"
When will Dell laptops get 13th gen Intel CPUs?
"Hello all,

As I'm sure many of you know, Intel released a bunch of new 13th gen laptop CPUs just last week at CES 2023. So naturally, I'm curious as to when we'll be able to get Dell laptops with the new Raptor lake processors. I doubt anyone actually has an exact timeline, but I'd like to know what you all think.

I'd really like to buy a Precision 5770 here soon, Its current 12th gen CPU is perfectly fine, but if 13th gen version is coming soon, I'd hold out for that.

Brand new Inspiron 16 5620 Touchpad stops working when lid closed
" As stated, brand new Inspiron laptop received Friday, 1/6.  Setting it up for a friend.  Windows 11 Home 22H2.

Completely setup and updated including Dell drivers, and MS patches.

When the laptop lid is closed for more than a minute or two, the touchpad no longer works when the lid is reopened. The I2C HID Device has the dreaded yellow sign that the device cannot be started, and a number of other devices in that section have ""disappeared"".  Sometimes disabling/re-enabling the device will bring back the touchpad, sometimes not.  Sometimes re-installing the drive will bring back the touchpad, sometimes not.  Sometimes the touchpad doesn't work even after a reboot.

As I said, all drivers are up-to-date, and have turned off the option for the computer to turn off the device to save power.

I have done a Windows refresh install saving user settings/data.  Have done a complete fresh install of Windows - all to no avail.

I have spent at least an hour on the phone with Dell tech support, and another hour on a Microsoft support chat session - all to no avail.  (Both while the techs were remoted into the system.)

In searching the Internet and here on Reddit, I have seen many complaints about this issue but no solutions.

Can Dell please help with this issue!!!

Try to Get Upgrade Pricing and Parts List for PowerEdge R740 Server

Double charged by Dell for an order 6 months ago
"Got charged for an order in July 2022. December 2022 actually posted the same exact charge and amount and I have nothing in my order history since October 2022. When I saw the charge initially I thought it would fall off since I havenâ€™t bought anything with Dell, but it posted. Not sure what the heck to do since Dell told me that I was lying but I literally have both credit card statements. Maybe this is some move to squeeze money out of customers and hope they donâ€™t notice. Super scummy and will probably file a chargeback. Havenâ€™t charged back in 5 years before goddamn Dell is scummy."
Windows 11 Coming to Older Machines?
"I was wondering what the likelihood is that Windows 11 will officially be supported on older hardware. I am currently using the XPS9560 with a Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700HQ, which says it is not officially supported. I have plenty of power throughout the rest of my system with 32 GB ram and a GTX 1050, so I'm pretty disappointed that I can't get Windows 11. Does anyone know the likelihood that older CPUs will get official support?"
XPS 13 9360 Can't install audio driver after MoBo replacement
"I have an XPS 13 9360 that stopped working and gave the one white, two amber blinking lights on the front to indicate a CPU/motherboard failure. I did some troubleshooting and couldn't get it to work so I bought a replacement board off eBay (with warranty).  I originally had a 7th gen i7 but I bought a board with the 8th gen quad core i7 (i7-8550U). The swap went well and after updating BIOS and drivers everything works except the audio driver fails to install. I get error 0x000003e6 'Invalid access to memory location'.

I have tried the following things:

* Manually downloading latest audio and graphics drivers both from Dell and Intel websites
* Updating the driver automatically from device manager
* Uninstalled the device and scanned for hardware changes from device manager
* Windows built-in troubleshooter

Any ideas?

XPS 15 9500 charger keeps burning out
"

I have an apartment setup where my laptop was plugged into a 130W charger and a thunderbolt 3.0 to DisplayPort connector, which leads to a 144hz monitor. Both the monitor and charger are plugged into a surge protector (Protector led has consistently been on). Somehow, plugging my laptop into this setup has caused 3 chargers to blow up / burnout. 2 were a 130W charger, one of which burned a port and led me to send in my laptop to be repaired by Dell. They replaced my motherboard and bottom casing, but now the 90W charger Iâ€™ve used to replace the 130W chargers due to a fear of too much power in my system has burnt out too. I have no idea what is causing my chargers to be destroyed, as I had no issues with this setup at my dorm last year. Please let me know if you can think of any problems / solutions."

Dell small business refund frustration
"I am really fed up with Dell. Back in June I ordered a SMB enterprise gear for $20000 which was shipped after almost three months and I figured they sold me the wrong hardware (completely their fault, imagine they sold me something that needed extra equipment to work with and that wasn't discussed by their solution team) So I returned that item and requested refund (Late October) The refund was processed just a few days ago. (More than two months or 40 business days I suppose with numerous follow-ups)  


Now, there was another order for $24000 which I'd paid right at the time the other one didn't work out. After a few days of chatting with a few IT professionals, I realized their second option also wasn't a good product to my need so I found an alternative and asked Dell to stop the order and asked for refund. Now the problem is they said, they didn't even process the order so they cannot refund the money and had me contact their support/financial team to resolve the issue. But guess what after more than two months the support person asked me to dispute the transaction from my bank because for some unknown reason they cannot do it on their end. I called my bank of course and they said such request can take up to 35 business days just to get investigated and even then they cannot guarantee to reverse the transaction and the seller is responsible not the bank.   


So I keep calling Dell support line and after very long wait times they say oh you should call whatever other number and then you call that number and they ask you to call the very first number... I mean this is just ridiculous. I have my tax payment due right now and I have to pay it out personal funds to avoid penalties because these douchebags are still holding my money! How's this not illegal! I don't understand how they can get away with such horrendous practices.   


I saw someone talking about filing a complaint to BBB. Does that help at all? I am in Canada though.  


And I guess people need to be very careful with this company. They apparently only care about their big corporate customers and not even small businesses. Very poor practice. I wish I can find an alternative for their products and service."
T5610 PSU upgrade from 825W to 1300W?
" Hello,  so I have a T5610 workstation I am using as a render & AI server  currently. I have a RTX 3060 as well as two E5-2667 v2 CPUs in it and  128gb of ram. It currently has a 825W PSU and I would like to upgrade it  to be able to run a Tesla K80 (TDP 300W) in it along side the RTX 3060.  I have heard that some T7610s' 1300W PSU models do fit and run in  T5610s but I have also heard that because of the power distribution  board (PDB), the PSU is not able to provide more than around 900-1000W.

Some  people have tried to do this before and have suggested to use the  T7610's power distribution board, but I am unsure if it would fit in the  case, and how the connectors would go for the motherboard and other  plugs so I am unsure if it would work. So right now I am kind of stuck  in how I would go about upgrading this PSU and having the computer being  able to not be limited by the PDB."

Any Workaround for Dell Client Management Service Disabling Itself?
"Hey all, I do end user IT for my organization and once or twice a month, a user's Dell Command Update application will become unresponsive. This problem occurs due to the Dell Client Management Service becoming disabled. Unfortunately my position doesn't have admin rights, so I need to work through our field techs in order to have the service restarted.

Does anybody know a root cause for the service disabling itself? Any preventative measures would be lovely. 

My office has about 30 staff and we've noticed over time that the issue usually affects the same people. We all have the same laptops and Dell Thunderbolt Docking stations, as well as Dell Monitors, so I don't think it's due to peripheral devices. The only differing peripherals are based on job function, but the people who are commonly affected actually have the least of any area. 

This has been occurring since version 4.4.0 and we are still experiencing it on 4.7.1. Let me know if any additional information would be helpful and I'll provide what I can. Thanks!"

P2723QE vs S2722QC
"Looking for advice on which is the better monitor, given basically identical prices. Will be used at a home office with quite a lot of natural light. The panels seem to have the same brightness.

Canâ€™t find many reviews on the P2723QE, but the previous P2721Q seems to have been well reviewed. The S2722QC receives a lot of praise as well. 

One difference is the number of USB ports, which isnâ€™t very important, and both have sufficient PD wattage - Iâ€™ll need 60W and the Pâ€™s 95W is more than enough, and the S has 65W which also is enough."
Battery drop 37-7 in 15mins
"Hi. I use Dell Latitude 7490 i5 touch screen. I've been browsing 6hrs straight from 90battery. After dropping 40, in 15mins battery drop from 37-7. The shop said battery will last around 5hrs. So I'm not sure is my battery bad or normal. Are you guys happening the same."

Keyboard conundrum
"So, my company (started a new job today) got me an 15"" XPS (9520). I'm a Thinkpad guy. The machine is fine so far, looks nice, works alright, few complaints (ignoring that it comes with malware/bloatware preinstalled and that Win11 is .. not great). There's one thing that already drives me mad after 8+ hours of using it: The keyboard.

Is there ANY way to have both function keys (F1-F12 - all of them) without the FN nonsense AND have a home/end key? I need all the Fx keys for work (some more than others, but F3, F4, F5, F8, F9, F10, F11, F12 are a constant thing for me to use and I always always always always need Home and End. Ctrl + Home / Ctrl + End is something I use every few minutes. Home and End are on ""F11"" and ""F12"" (in quotes, because the way Fn and Fx keys are handled makes zero sense to me).

Is there a software solution? Did anyone figure out a way to fix this mess? I .. plan to carry a keyboard everywhere with this laptop otherwise, because this is breaking things for me one way or the other a bunch of times, every hour. I can either have Fx keys (non-negotiable) or Home/End (desperately needed). How do you guys handle this?"
"Hi everyone, i bought an Xps laptop and it has one year express guarantee. I bought it in ebay and the seller said it written that it has 2 years, 1 is the express premium and the 2 years is dell (in german HÃ¤ndlergarantie) seller/trader guarantee. Does such thing exists?"
Latitude 5591 screen upgrade
" I have a refurb 5591 with a 1366x768 screen that I would like to upgrade. Looking up the service tag, there are two part #s listed under the heading **391-BDSD : Non-touch 15.6 HDF AG EDP1.2, Ultra Slim BOE LCD (1366 x 768 )**


* **XNHVP**	INFO,SWSI,LCD,15.6,NON-TCH	1
* **HRN6M**	Liquid Crystal Display,15.6,High Definition,AG,Embedded Display Port,Au Optronics Corp	1

Looking them up, **XNHVP** is 1920x1080 and **HRN6M** is 1366x768, so I'm assuming the former was taken out and replaced with the latter during refurb? Would this mean that I should be ok to order the **XNHVP** 1920x1080 screen and it should be compatible? Do I need to worry about anything else eg. cable? Looks like they both require the same one. I should be able to handle the install myself, but I just don't have the technical knowledge to feel comfortable navigating the compatibility landscape without some reassurance. Thank you!"
Fan speed on R720xd
"Got free hand me down R720xd systems. One is running ESXi and the other is running Windows 2019. The esxi system has all the fans running around 8k, the windows box has 5 of them running at 9k and the last one at 10k. The CPU temps on the ESXi system are 8 degrees higher but the fans are running slower. All the temps are in the green. I can't find anything that's configured differently between the systems.

Is it worth it to upgrade to thunderbolt 4 from usb c for a docking station?
I've got a xps 13 9310 and luckily my computer has thunderbolt support; though I've never used it.  I've been researching usb hubs and docking stations and of course the ones with thunderbolt 4 compatibility are way more expensive so I came here to ask you folks if it would be worth the upgrade?
Optiplex 7080 SFF
"I wanted to ask if anyone knew if it would be possible to upgrade the OEM power supply that comes in my Optiplex 7080 SFF? It currently has a 200w power supply and I would like to bump it up to 240W+ for a single slot GPU card. 

I saw on eBay that there is a 260W power supply for the MT (tower version) that uses the same 3 plugs as the 200W one I have. There is about inches of open length space in my SFF for a longer power supply. Iâ€™m not looking to do anything crazy, just bump it up a bit to cover my tracks.

Dell website RAM specs for Dell G15 5525 wrong??
"The Dell website claims that the Max RAM Capacity for the Dell G15 5525 is 32GB and only supports these combinations:
>1 8GB
>2 8GB
Or
>2 16GB

But, when I get the maximum ram capacity info from the command prompt, it's over 64GB...
67,108,964Kilobytes, to be exact...

Is the Dell website just wrong, and unaware that it's providing the wrong information and my computer indeed CAN support another 32GB on top of the 32 I currently have?

Or is the command prompt drawing the information directly from my hardware somehow wrong, and my real max capacity is only half of the amount that it says?

If someone can let me know, that would be great.

I would have just upgraded it myself and not paid Geek squad, but ive only had the computer for a little over the month and I have a 2 year warranty and it just seemed silly to void it by upgrading it myself instead of just paying geeksquad 40 bucks one time and keep my warranty. 

But, if I've gotta now purchase two 32GB sticks and then pay geeksquad to install THEM too, because Dell doesn't know what the specs for their own machines are, then I'm going to be thoroughly annoyed."

XPS 15 9650 i7 - Worth fixing screen?
"Hey everyone. 

I've owned my XPS 15 9650 i7 since 2018. It's been fine but recently my screen broke and a shop in my area quote $250-300 to fix it. 

Do you think it's worth the fix vs. buying a new laptop? I mostly just use it for office-related things."
Strange issue with Dell XPS 15
"Laptop is fully charged, however when I press the power button to turn it on, all that happens is that the keyboard lights up for several seconds, then everything turns back off. The screen never turns on at all. I am unsure what the issue could be, however I had a similar issue previously, after I had left my XPS 15 sitting for a while without being charged or used, but that issue resolved after I charged it. I then ended up depleting the battery to the point where it automatically turned off (bad idea I know), and now even after a full charge it won't boot.  
I did notice that the date/time was off by several days when I first booted it recently, could this be a issue with the CMOS battery?"
XPS 9300 Not Charging
"I noticed today that my XPS 9300 was not charging from its included adaptor. I was at university when I noticed this and a friend's Mac charger worked just fine- it seemed slower than normal and she has a 16"" MBP which I understand to have a much beefier adaptor than the 9300- but it was charging. I got home and tried it on my both the 45W Dell charger and my Xperia's 18W charger and neither of them will charge it.  


I assumed that since my friend's Mac charger worked that maybe it's a problem with the adaptor so I have a replacement on the way. I've heard that letting it run down to flat- or nearly flat- and plugging it in while switched off is a reliable temporary solution. 

If the new charger doesn't work either, and the workaround also fails, what other avenues are open to me? Is there a problematic software update that's happened recently, or might it be something to do with the laptop itself."

Dead and stuck pixels on Dell U3223QE after one month of usage
"I noticed about 7 black dots on my screen (they are pretty noticeable, not sure if it's dirt or dead pixels) and one stuck pixel (red) after one month of usage.

Dell promises a replacement even if 1 dead pixel appears on Ultrasharp models. I asked my store to replace the monitor but for some reason they told me that they did not replace it, but FIXED it. Although I contacted Dell and they agreed to replace it if the store contacts them.

As I know it is impossible to fix dead pixels, so replacement is the only option. And I'm afraid that if the screen had dead pixels and they somehow fixed it, it will appear again on the same screen.

I will receive the monitor in about a week and will see what did they do.

What do you suggest me to do? Do I insist on a replacement?"
Dell G5 5000 - RAM upgrade
"I have a Dell g5 with 10700 Intel. 

I currently have 2 * 8 GB RAM stick (3200 MHz) that runs at 2933 MHz. 

I just recently bought 2*8gb from crucial (80$ Cad)both after installation the speed went down to 2400mhz

So most probably the mix match lower the speed. 

I'm in a discussion with Dell to get the proper upgrade. 

They have 3 options to get what I'm looking for but it's different in terms of pricing and most probably with the specs. 

Option A : add the same stick - 1rx16 - 130$ cad each for a total of 260 $ for the upgrade

Dell G15 5511 - Audio port mic problem
"so the problem is that I was trying to connect my friend's headphones to my laptop audio port. Output works fine ( i mean speakers of headphones are working fine ) but mic doesn't work.

so this problem is from the laptop ( i mean my laptop doesn't support splitter system or what because I've also tried to only connect friend's headphones mic jack but my laptop wasn't picking up the mic ) ?

additional : headphones have 2 audio jacks ( 1 for speakers and 1 for mic ) and my friend uses a splitter to connect it to his laptop. headphones speakers and mic works fine in his laptop but mic doesn't work on my laptop. the mic of my laptop (Microphone Array Intel) works everywhere mic is needed"

Help with my PC - out of ideas
"Have an Optiplex 7060 here that was working great up until two days ago when it began suddenly shutting down with no warning. Sfc /scannow found persistent errors and after doing everything I could think to do I ended up wiping it and starting over. Finally no integrity issues. 

Well, it is absolutely insane with random freezing now, becoming completely unresponsive. When I shut it off, it won't stay off but rather turns back on and never displays anything. If I power it down and unplug it, it does the same thing 9 times out of ten, and when it does display 9 times out of 10 it just freezes at the Windows welcome screen. Yes, I'm trying up to 100 times just to get into Windows.

Further problem: before this all happened I was having constant issues with my monitors (also Dell, drivers good). I have the on board Intel drivers and an additional AMD Radeon card. At this point since the displays usually weren't connecting I switched to a TV, using a USB to HDMI adapter. I have thus far been unable to get into the BIOS at all, but I don't know what to really check there. I can reattach my monitors to try that since the TV adapter won't kick on until windows starts, I suppose; but I'm pretty sure there's something wrong with them since the software/firmware is peachy.

At this point, with a fresh windows install and extremely bad performance, I'm not sure what to do. There are no integrity issues and my windows update is up to date and I've gotten everything I can think to get from SupportAssist.

What's my next step here?

EDIT: Oh yeah, the light. It mostly flashes orange (meaning no display detected) for TV or monitors, but about 25% of the time it is solid white and still doesn't display anything on either. Also, I can't make it stay off unless I unplug it, and as soon as it's plugged in it turns on. Often it goes into a loop of shutting down and restarting."

Dell False Advertising
"**TLDR:** Dell sells laptops with a more expensive Core i9 12900HK CPU option and promotes it as unlocked on the website.

However, after a few BIOS upgrades, Dell completely locks the CPU, decreases its performance without notice, and blocks the BIOS downgrade.

The undervolting is blocked using a new feature called [Undervolting Protection](https://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/10ojbbq/intel_undervolt_protection/), which is enabled by default and activated through BIOS updates.

Recent Dell XPS 15 and 17, Inspiron, Alienware, and other laptops are affected.

==================

**Update 1**: on January 14, 2023, Dell confirmed that the **performance was decreased intentionally after the BIOS update for the safety of the user and the product**. The system is working as per the design.

Question (01-14-2023 06:20 AM):

>Why do I have a significant performance drop after the BIOS update? Is it according to your design?

Answer from Dell (01-14-2023 06:36 AM):

>Yes, the system working as per design. It's for protecting the hardware, and all rights are reserved by the manufacturer, for the safety of the user and the product.

==================

**Update 2:** I have done additional research and found that in November and December, Intel released a few updates for their microcode to patch a bunch of vulnerabilities: CVE-2022-30704, CVE-2022-33894, CVE-2019-17178, and others. They were released for all the platforms supporting Intel Core 12 and 13 generations. In addition, vendors like Dell, Lenovo, HP, and others released security BIOS updates in November and December.

Unfortunately, the new version of the microcode decreases the CPU performance and completely locks undervolting. Negative voltage offsets are not applied.

Dell does not care about users who paid for the unlocked CPU. They decided to go even further and lock the BIOS downgrade.

Regular users will not notice the 5-15% difference in performance. As for more advanced ones, Dell support will tell that they measure the performance incorrectly using third-party apps like Cinebench R23.

==================

**Update 3**: HP [confirmed](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPOmen/comments/yejp66/qa_for_vbs_and_impact_to/) that the Intel's new microcode 2210 for Alder and Raptor Lake platforms does not allow setting voltage below the default values. Also, Tom from XMG also [confirmed](https://www.reddit.com/r/XMG_gg/comments/10cimqk/comment/j4iqobf/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that this is possible through the microcode updates.

==================

**Update 4:** Intel [officially confirmed](https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/10raw6a/lets_talk_about_undervolting/) that they have introduced a new feature called [Undervolting Protection](https://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/10ojbbq/intel_undervolt_protection/), which blocks undervolting and is activated using BIOS updates.

According to the ""recommended BIOS settings"" it should be enabled by default. Each vendor decides whether to keep it enabled or create a setting allowing modifying it.

At this point, Dell keeps this feature enabled and does not have any visible or hidden settings in BIOS allowing to control it.

==================

**Full Story:**

I purchased a Dell XPS 17 9720 laptop six months ago. I decided to go with the more expensive Core i9 12900HK CPU option because it was (and is) advertised as unlocked. I've paid extra $300 for this upgrade.

You can open the [product page](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/xps-17-laptop/spd/xps-17-9720-laptop), click on the **Which processor is right for you?** link, then on the  [Learn more about Intel processors.](https://www.dell.com/en-us/lp/hmc-intel-processor-consumer) link at the bottom, and scroll down to the **What do the letters on IntelÂ® Processors mean?** question.

The HK CPUs are advertised as unlocked:

* **HK â€“ High performance optimized for mobile, unlocked**

https://preview.redd.it/iexhojflkgba1.png?width=1294&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8e6492b8aa5be0397d5ad46b138ea705d9613981

There is no notices or limitations. It is marked as unlocked without any additional notices and restrictions. 12900HK belongs to HK series as well as 11980HK used in XPS 9510 and 9710 from 2021.

Then I decided to use this feature and adjust voltages using the Intel XTU utility, which [officially supports](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/17881/intel-extreme-tuning-utility-intel-xtu.html) the 12900HK CPU. Unlocked CPUs allow users to adjust voltages, because they are ""unlocked"" ([What Is the Difference between an Unlocked and a Locked Processor?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000058654/processors.html))

But I've got an error ""Undervolt Protection"". I've tried other tools like Throttle Stop, but they also do not work.

https://preview.redd.it/lpd1ogflkgba1.png?width=753&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=49ba2115ac5d03e7eb749364d4c27d9e78c3e756

Previously, I did some research and found that there's a way to enable voltage adjustments using two settings called CFG Lock and Overclocking Lock. The whole process is described [here](https://brendangreenley.com/undervolting-2020-dell-laptops-like-the-vostro-7500-and-more-tips-to-improve-thermals-battery-life-and-speed/#cpu-undervolt).

It was working smoothly with ThrottleStop on my device till I updated the BIOS to 1.12.0 and 1.13.1. I have described it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DellXPS/comments/1019me5/dell_xps_17_9720_issue_with_undervolting_after/).

Unfortunately, I decided to give Dell a chance and update to the new version 1.14.0, hoping that this issue was fixed. But no, the voltage adjustments do not work on this version either.

Also, I've found that Dell made some changes to a new BIOS version, which [decreased the performance by 17%](https://www.dell.com/community/XPS/XPS-17-Severe-performance-degradation-after-BIOS-upgrade/td-p/8330515). It is a pretty substantial number and out of range of measurement error.

Ok, it looks not so great, so I decided to roll back to the last working BIOS version (1.11.0) like I did with 1.12.0 and 1.13.1, but in this case, **the BIOS downgrade was intentionally blocked by Dell**.

There was an error: ""BIOS Update blocked due to unsupported downgrade.""

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/aybieq2pkgba1.jpg?width=2351&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a743d96f1e61dfb984c94d151daae9192cc71b36

I tried different options, including using the built-in BIOS downgrade feature (Ctrl + Esc) and force downgrade, but I got the same message.

I decided to contact Dell and try to resolve this problem or at least to downgrade the BIOS. Case numbers are 159930395 and 159915790. Those cases were simply closed and I was advised to call the  **Out of Warranty Deptartment** (+1 877-409-3272).

Great! I have a device under warranty with Dell Premium Support, and now I need to call the out-of-warranty service and probably pay for that.

Also, I was told that the CPU was locked intentionally for security reasons. I'm aware of plundervolt vulnerability from 2019, but if a company decides to patch that and lock the CPU, it should not be advertised as unlocked. The better option is to allow customers to choose if they want to use it or not.

Dell had enough time to do that but decided to deceive customers, which is illegal.

This problem affects not only with XPS 15 9520 and 17 9720 but many other modern Dell laptops, including XPS 15 and 17 from the previous year, and many Inspiron and Alienware devices with HK processors.

As for the performance degradation, Dell suggested waiting for the new BIOS. Maybe, it will solve the problem, but considering my previous experience, it does not.

Anyway, false advertising is illegal in many countries. I think we should not tolerate that and let vendors cut the features customers paid for.

I'm not covering other quality control issues with my device. It's a completely different story.

That's my experience."

"Dell Tower 7920, intending to use as full blown server - But can't find the rear cage kits!!"
"I recently acquired a Dell Tower 7920 that I intend to use to replace a number of older boxes.

The plan is to put in a couple of 22 Core Gold Processors, 8 large drives in a RAID6 setup and a fair amount of ram.

The storage will be used for a number of things and as I already have an LTO7 drive I'm not worried about backups or failure as there's nothing particularly time sensitive in the data.  The memory and high spec CPUs are so I can also use it as a 4-6 VM platform, thus why it's allowing me to retire a number of older boxes.

However, I'm finding it quite difficult to find the Rear Cages for the drives at anything approaching a sensible price (relative to what I paid for the 7920).

My DELL XPS 15 7590's warranty is coming to an end - should I sell it?
"After its years of service, the warranty of my DELL XPS 15 7590 will end on July.

I've been mostly very happy with the computer: nice performance and pretty solid hardware (I travel a lot and the machine mostly withstood its trials).

However, the warranty proved to be really worth it, as the computer had its fair share of issues: swollen battery after the first year, and a dead LCD after the second year. Suffice to say, I'm a bit anxious about still depending on the computer after the warranty ends.

Should I sell it, and if so, where and for how much? Does DELL have a service where I can maybe resell my old laptop and buy a newer model at a reduced price? What newer model would be best to replace a XPS 15 7590?

Any advice will be greatly appreciated! Cheers to you all :)"

Dell 14 Portable Monitor ( C1422H ) | Connecting to a Gaming PC (RTX 3070)

"DELL XPS 17 9710 (I7 11800H | 32GB RAM | RTX3050) - BIOS issue when changing a setting 2 AMBER LIGHTS, 8 WHITE LIGHTS ""Display failure - EC detection of power rail failure""."
"Hello everyone, 

I purchased an XPS 17 9710 in January 2020 and just after 1 week of use I entered the UEFI BIOS (version 1.6.0) and changed some settings, nothing serious just the keyboard backlight and battery settings. 

After restart, the pc wonÂ´t pass Dell logo (no post) as Dell call it. And the status light in the front of the laptop flashed 2 times AMBER and 8 times WHITE. Started to research on it and found out that according to Dell **""Display failure - EC detection of power rail failure"".** Dell Support team troubleshooted the device and then advice for a motherboard replacement due to the that power rail failure. A month later I received my device and entered BIOS... I was in real disbelief when **AGAIN** the same happened, and again the motherboard was replaced.

After the second replacement I updated the UEFI BIOS firmware to the latest version and as my warranty is running out, I contacted Dell to talk about this. The support agent ran a couple of test on my computer and advised to enter the Boot menu and run an extensive diagnostic on the machine. 

Every test passed without any issues, and from that same boot menu screen I entered the BIOS once again almost 1 year after the 2Â° MOBO replacement. It went OK, I just browsed through the options without making any change whatsoever. 

I do not have the confidence to make any changes to a BIOS setting even with the latest firmware. The laptop has been working flawlessly, I just donÂ´t want to lose my pc for 1 month again while Dell issues a replacement for me. 

Do Anyone has had this issue? Could you please confirm if recent BIOS firmware do not compromise the power rail as it happened twice to me?

Any help would be appreciated.Â "

Dell 7420 - freezes and crashes unless c-state disabled

Through some monkeying around, I've determined the device works completely fine when the bios option (Performance > Enable C-State Control) is set to OFF.    I've confirmed the device no longer crashes for extended periods of time.  No power management is not ideal on a laptop though...

Regarding bios versions.  I've upgrade a few different times and tried various bios versions.  I am utilizing the latest 1.22.0 bios at this time.  No dice so far.  Windows is also fully updated.

Actually disable MaxxAudio for headphones only?
"TL;DR: Even if all the MaxxAudio settings are turned off, audio is still being routed through it, which alters it behind the scenes. If I disable Audio Enhanchments in Windows Audio settings the audio stops working. Is it possible to actually disable MaxxAudio for headphones without affecting integrated speakers?

&#x200B;

I recently bought a Dell Inspiron 16 Plus 7620 which I am using for music production. I normally use an external audio interface and studio monitor headphones. Once, I plugged my monitors directly in the headphones jack and completely disabled all the MaxxAudio stuff, but something about the sound was off, to the point that I thought the headphones could have been damaged from one of the countless drops. So I plugged the headphones into the external interface and listened to the same recording: they sounded completely different, even if the MaxxAudio EQ was flat and all the other settings (NeuralDSP, Spacial Audio etc..) were toggled off. The signal coming from the integrated soundcard seemed to have some light compression and EQ applied, which might be barely noticeable (and maybe even sound good) on small consumer earbuds, but you can definitely hear it on studio headphones with flat frequency response, and it makes music sound very bad.

So I tried disabling Audio Enhanchements in the built-in soundcard settings, like I had already done to the external audio interface to avoid audio being routed through MaxxAudio, but then the audio went completely MUTE. When trying to play the test sound, it would fail with ""Error opening audio device"". The only way to get sound working again was to enable again the Audio Enhanchements through Windows Audio settings. Tried updating the drivers from Dell website, disabling enhanchements on speakers also, rebooting etc.., but nothing changed.

Is there a way to COMPLETELY disable MaxxAudio only for wired headphones without affecting the speakers? Normally, I would have gotten rid of all the DSP stuff completely, but the integrated speakers sound extremely bad without it."

Avoid Dell Inspiron 16 Plus 7620 - Regret decades long of laptop brand preference...
"I will probably be avoiding Dell after this faulty design only to be superseded by even worse support.

Ultimately I have had the trackpad issue where it intermittently starts and stops working due to lack of grounding...

It's literally the exact same design flaw carried over from the Dell Inspiron 16 7610 carried over to the Dell Inspiron 16 7620 as noted by the many people [here](https://www.dell.com/community/Inspiron/inspiron-16-plus-Touch-pad-not-working/td-p/8231254), [here](https://www.dell.com/community/Inspiron/Inspiron-16-7620-2-in-1-Touchpad-issues/td-p/8282247), and [here](https://www.dell.com/community/Inspiron/inspiron-16-plus-Touch-pad-not-working/m-p/8231282/highlight/true#M147354)

I did not realize the immediate severity or root cause of this issue... to my own demise. 

This laptop spent 7 weeks waiting for a replacement panel after the backlight went out. Then after that was finally fixed I figured I should get to the bottom of my trackpad issue. But after researching the issue to my horror did I realize how badly I underestimated what I figured was just a driver issue...

So I reach out to Dell support figuring maybe they'll understand... Upfront I provide video of the touchpad intermittently working on the ePSA all tests passed (and from the BIOS screen) to eliminate the OS and drivers, it takes Dell support about a week to get on the same page, another 2 weeks for them to tell me to wait another 3 weeks for the BIOS v1.9 drivers which they are very confident will work! I am extremely skeptical, well on Jan 10 the new drivers came out, I tested them out today and what do you know, it doesn't make a difference. Now Dell wants to replace the trackpad... I asked Dell to exchange out the laptop for a different model or for a refund. Since I can't keep dragging this on. Dell Support basically told me to kick rocks. 

They only offered to replace my trackpad which I'm not opposed to, but their ePSA says the hardware is fine. So they're going to replace the hardware their own diagnostic software tells them is fine? I use my laptop for work, I'm dual booting Linux and Windows, I'm an Android & Web Dev so I'm using a huge suite of dev tools, IDEs, VMs, and a ton of other env configurations and keys to setup. It takes a minute to prep for a Dell Tech to work on my system, on top of waiting another month with this issue? Just for it to not work?

I think I can work this out with my credit card company who offers additional protection and I can prove that due to the freaking past 14 weeks that I've been waiting on Dell's support and maybe the other reports of this issue that Dell sold me faulty electronics and provide me a refund and I can hunk this piece of junk.

In reality I really like this laptop but I need for it to work without a physical mouse attached. On the other hand Dell Support has been so abhorrent I am probably going to end up staying away from Dell for all of my future purchases."
G15 Ryzen Edition Keyboard Replacement
Does Dell still do keyboard/key replacements for this model? The paint started wearing off and I absolutely hate how it looks. There isn't really any other issue but I've only had this for about 11 months.
"Dell Inspiron 3505 stopped charging, then came up with this DPC WATCHDOG VIOLATION. When running diagnostics it says the battery is fine but there is an issue with the AC power. Have tested the power cable and tried another, both working fine. Any ideas? Have owned it for two years."
Troubleshooting: U3821DW + OWC + two M1 Macs. Can anyone help?
"\[UPDATED BECAUSE I SOLVED ONE OF THE PROBLEMS\] I have two M1 Macs (one Pro, one Air), which I want to connect to my U3821DW. I have installed the drivers available on the site, as well as the firmware updates, and restarted both laptops.

* I'm trying to connect the **Pro** through my **OWC Thunderbolt dock** using the **USB-C**, mainly because that is what I've been doing with my previous monitor and I have ethernet etc running through that.
* I'm attempting to connect the **Air** via **HDMI** using the Apple-issue **USB-HDMI dongle**.

For some reason if I connect the Dell-provided HDMI cable to my Air using the Apple dongle, the laptop registers the U3821DW and shows it as a display, but the screen on the display is black.

I don't understand what's happening here - why would it be picking up on the HDMI but the display remain black?"
Optiplex 3080 SFF - where can I buy an optical-drive module (bracket)?
"My Optiplex 3080 SFF came with an optical disk drive, but I didnâ€™t need it so I just didnâ€™t bother putting it back in after I upgraded the m.2 drive.  Now, I find myself wanting to add a 3.5â€ drive to the computer.  

I found and purchased the â€œhard-disk drive moduleâ€ from a seller on ebay, but didnâ€™t realize until it arrived that it needed to be attached to the â€œoptical-disk drive moduleâ€, which I can no longer find.

Iâ€™ve search ebay and Google in general and have not had any luck finding somewhere to get a replacement one - can anyone help me find one?  **To be clear, Iâ€™m not looking for the optical drive itself, I just want to have the piece of metal that the hard drive module needs to mount on securely.**

Thanks!"

Do I need a new fan?
"Btw Iâ€™m not a pc guy so pls answer in an easy way to understand.

So I recently installed a new case fan on my sell 5090 G5 pc (pre built). This is because the old fan was very loud. Now whenever I turn on my pc it does a â€˜pre boot system performance checkâ€™ and says my motherboard fan is not responding. I never had this issue before my new fan. All plugs are in and thereâ€™s little to no dust. Do I need a new motherboard fan?"
Worse performance while charging via USB 3?
"So my Inspiron 15's (7591 9750h, gtx1650) charger kicked the bucket. Shouldn't tell whether it was the power brick itself, or just the socket on the laptop that died, so didn't bother to replace it.

Instead, I've poached an XPS15 (2021 I think?) charger. Same power rating of 130W, but USB-C instead of barrel. Works fine in most use cases but whenever I try to game, it seems to have weaker performance?

It's a thunderbolt 3 port, and I've run the laptop off a docking station at work before, so assumed it'd be fine just to use the XPS one. Is there some kind of limit on power delivery through thunderbolt I'm not aware of?"
Dell Laptop Drivers Repair
"Hey, Iâ€™m new here so if my terminology is wrong or anything like that please forgive me. I have a 2020 Dell Inspiron 7591 2n1 with intel 7 and recently Iâ€™ve had problems with the battery dying quickly and some blue screens. I looked it up online and was told it was probably my drivers so I ran a verifier test to try to fix the problem and it just made my laptop extremely slow without really helping me. I reset the drivers to original settings and the speed went back to normal; but I messaged a repair company about a repair since after running a diagnosis I got a screen saying there were hardware problems with my laptop. The repair company told me it was probably the drivers and that it would be $150 to fix. Does this sound right, or is there a way for me to fix the problem SAFELY cheaper? Iâ€™m relatively illiterate when it comes to operating systems so if itâ€™s easier to just get someone to fix the problem for me then thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ll do. Thank you in advance for your help!!"
Dell laptop repair question
"I sent my laptop in for repair and the condition was pretty much flawless. I contacted them today to get an ETA, and they nonchalantly threw in that there were major scratches on the top and bottom. I took pictures prior to sending it in so I have proof, but has anyone had a device from Dell returned in worse condition then sent out? I'm definitely starting to get concerned what it's going to look like when it is returned."

Warranty voided?
"I want to buy an used XPS 9305, but the seller says he got the keyboard replaced since the wanted to change the language layout (both european). I checked the S/N code and it's still covered by the 2 yr european warranty. Would the keyboard replacement void the warranty if I ever needed to repair (assuming it's NOT a keyboard related issue, like for example a faulty usb port)?

Assuming I'm able to switch back to the original keyboard, would it still void the warranty?"

Low audio - Dell G15 5515 Ryzen Edition
"Hello everybody!

I've had a problem for a few weeks now but I haven't been able to solve it, which is that the sound coming out of my Dell G15 is lower than normal.

I remember before December, the sound was loud, I could even hear the bass. But I remember that out of nowhere, the sound that was powerful from one day to the next became ""lower"".

At the time, as I was having problems with the alienware command center, I had to restore the notebook to factory defaults, with the help of Dell support. I thought this would also solve the problem, but I was wrong.

The sound is still low, even using the alienware command center's sound enhancer, Nahimic, it's still not like before. I've tried downloading audio software that allows you to mix and amplify the sound, but it still doesn't come close to what it was before December.

Can you help me with this? Has anyone here gone through something similar?"
"Dell Technician comes to my house to replace my Alienware's mobo twice. First time, the backlighting doesn't work, they get me another motherboard, now the speakers don't work and the laptop parts aren't in correctly and are missing screws. They now want me to send in the laptop."
"I had a technician come to my place to replace my motherboard twice. The guy comes in, gives me another motherboard, and my backlighting now works. Now the issue is, the rep didn't install the back bar properly with a plastic piece sticking out (the arena light) and now Dell is giving me the run around. I don't get what their problem is. The guy that serviced my machine clearly was having a hard time and seemed frustrated but I didn't say anything. He fixes the laptop and I give him my signature (which I shouldn't have done) and now I have to call Dell again. Talking to their reps is a complete nightmare. Each time they want to do the usual remote in sessions and reinstall drivers etc which is fine, but these guys clearly don't want to just replace the machine for a properly functioning one, and are now asking me to send in the laptop to their repair center, so more time is wasted on this machine.


With that said, what is genuinely up with Dell and their warranty services? I literally have to beg the Dell phone reps for help on an issue that their service technicians keep causing because the reps clearly can't handle the job. Its all extremely frustrating and I really regret owning an Alienware/Dell. Kinda wish I went with another brand instead cause this is just getting to be too much.

Edit: rep forgot to plug the speaker into the motherboard. I went ahead and plugged it back in. Still irked that the rep messed up the arena shell though."

Dell pen/xps touch screen help
"I have had my dell xps for a few years now. It has a touch screen, dell pen compatible, with flippable screen.

Precision Tower 5810 with Ultraspeed Quad Adapter?
"I have a new Dell ultraspeed quad adapter with 2 NVMe drives installed that I want to install and use for booting in a Dell Precision Tower 5810 (in a RAID 1).  The Precision has the latest BIOS installed.

Dell explicitly says that the T5810 supports the ultraspeed adapter ([Link](https://i.dell.com/sites/doccontent/shared-content/data-sheets/en/Documents/Dell-Precision-Tower-5000-Series-5810-Spec-Sheet.pdf)), however I  cannot see either drive when I install the adapter in the system.  In fact, if I install the adapter in slot 3 (the other fully x16 channel slot in the T5810), the system won't even post (no video output).  If I put it in an x8 or x4 slot, the system will post, but will not see the drives.

I know this card requires PCIe bifurcation, but I have see no bios options to enable that.  I've used these adapters in other Precisions before (T5820s and T7820s), with success, so I'm not sure what's going wrong here.  I've seen other people online who have supposedly gotten this to work.  Anyone know what might be wrong?  We bought this adapter new, but could it be bad?  I did try to install it into another T5820 that we have and couldn't see the drives on that system either, though I wasn't sure which bios options needed to be set, so may not have had it configured correctly."

How to calibrate my 4K XPS 15 (9510) display with HDR off?
"I have decided to turn off HDR when not watching TV or movies on my laptop, as it uses up battery life, and looks bad when switching between bright and dark windows. However, the display colour is overly saturated when HDR is off.

I don't overcharge as I monitor the charging time as well. Is it the motherboard that's causing the issue or am I doing something wrong? The DELL Power Manager is set to Standard charging.

Help with DELL PE-R720 RAM Configuration much appreciated!
"Hi reddit,

I'm not sure where the best place is to post this but I'm getting poor performance in my proxmox VM's (w/ discrete GPU's passed through 1:1) and think the RAM configuration might be the problem. The issue exists even running only Windows Server 2019 - even within the OS and not any VM's/proxmox.

I've got a Dell R720 with 208 GB ram and dual E5-2650 V2's / dual 1100W redundant PSU's. I've made a quick spreadsheet with my current RAM population configuration and would really appreciate any advice if I'm going wrong or sub-optimally configuring the RAM. 

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n9S84k\_G7h4cZ9Vps-IHQWgL\_Z-C5hLXpqd278WcC4k/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n9S84k_G7h4cZ9Vps-IHQWgL_Z-C5hLXpqd278WcC4k/edit?usp=sharing)  

I'm seeing 3-4s lag after opening explorer/firefox/chrome in any VM (I'm running 2x Win11 w/32GB ram each) and stuttering after rapid mouse movements in a 2009 era game, despite both VM's having an entire GTX 1660 and 1060 (both 6GB VRAM) assigned to it respectively. 

I've installed the respective drivers for each and confirm no Code 43 errors / the GPU is utilised when  the game runs.  

I'm connecting to each VM via Moonlight @ 1080p 20mbps bitrate on a wired 1G connection and have also tried RDP (configured to use the GPU) 

**I'm not too worried about the poor gaming performance (so most of the above might be off-topic), more so the poor Windows performance.**

Please let me know if there's anything else to provide - or if this isn't the right place to post (apologies), where I should go to?

Thanks (and sorry for using an inactive account - I really shouldn't have deleted my old one 2 weeks ago!)"

Dell XPS 13 9365 (2019) - Running Windows 11 thoughts
"I inherited a XPS 13 9365, with an active pen. The specifications are quite good, an Intel i7 8500Y, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD. I installed Windows 11 via USB and had no issues whatsoever with the installation process, I have minimal applications installed. Literally Chrome, Photoshop, Office.

It's an absolute pain to use. The battery life is abysmal. This machine has hardly been used in the 4 years it's been around and the battery health is a measly 4,000mAh which is around the same as an iPhone.... The performance of this machine is genuinely shockingly bad. Takes around 3-4 minutes to open Photoshop, unable to play ANY HD content online without frame stutters, drop outs and buffering endlessly. Even with a gigabit connection.

All drivers are up to date, including BIOS, chipset, Windows updates and yet the laptop performs worse than a 2010 iMac. 

The laptop is genuinely unusable in 2023. Unable to watch footage back, unable to watch any 4K content at all. Locally or online, unable to render webpages quickly. 

The active pen seems great, except it has such a poor performance that stutters, lags, lines all appear randomly when using the pen on any touch input like Paint or Photoshop.

I do NOT recommend anyone pick this machine up, even if it was offered free. It's genuinely a useless e-waste device in 2023. I'm ashamed that Dell are able to produce these types of product that are obsolete after 3 years.

A Latitude that is 6 years old performs better with 5th gen i5 and 8GB of memory. With a better battery life!

I will make a full video on this soon but does anyone have any recommendations on what I can do to make this experience usable and not torturous to use?"

Upgrading the display from fhd to uhd on a precision 5520

CPU stuck at 0.78GHz - Latitud E7450

Upgrade module on WD19DCS docking station.

Moving SSD from old desktop to Optiplex micro (and removing old HDD that was there)
"I have two computers: desktop with SSD and windows 10 installed on it;
and
Optiplex 3050 micro tower with hdd with windows 10 on it

I want to get rid of the hdd from my Optiplex and replace it with SSD from my old desktop (which will be disposed of). Obviously simple unplugging and replacing the drives wonâ€™t work, but I donâ€™t know what exactly I should do to make this transition.

Both drives can be formatted if necessary, I backed up all data on external drive and cloud.

So basically I want to change hdd for sdd on my micro tower and reinstall fresh win 10 there. Could somebody help me or direct me to a clear and simple tutorial. Iâ€™m a noob in terms of terminologyâ€¦"

Just upgraded my Dell latitude e7450 screen from 1360x768 to 1920x1080
"Just sharing it here.

&#x200B;

[Image with new screen](https://imgur.com/Ip6cx0l)

&#x200B;

My dell latitude e7450 came with a bad 1360x768 screen. The viewing angles are horrible. I decided to buy a 1920x1080 screen replacement. It actually works, viewing angles and overall screen looks so much better. It is glossy though but the seller was kind enough to give a free screen protector (yes the bubbles are from the screen protector).

&#x200B;

My cpu are Core i5 5300u and Graphics is Intel HD 5500. The old panel and the new panel are both non-touch btw.

&#x200B;

Small Notes: Might want to have an extra bezel cover handy just in case you scratch yours (although mostly cosmetics), Matte LCD panel would've been better than glossy though. Or maybe just get something with a 1920x1080 outright."
How to replace OEM software after replacing hard drive
"Perhaps I shouldn't bother with this - but I have found Dell's SupportAssist tool quite helpful for driver updates and all that.  I am upgrading the drive in my laptop (XPS 13 7390 2-in-1) and plan to install a fresh copy of Windows 11.  Should I download the software separately, or does Dell have a tool for this kind of migration?"

Same problems with multiple different mice
"I have an Inspiron 3593 laptop. A while back I had a Logitech mouse that on occasion would have problems with the left button not registering, which would make clicking and dragging very difficult with the button randomly un-clicking in the middle. Eventually this last summer the mouse would just go unresponsive at random times.

So I bought a new one, also a Logitech. A couple months ago it started experiencing the same clicking problems. Then a few weeks ago the unresponsiveness came. I was reluctant to buy a new one immediately because I thought I might need to choose more carefully (and avoid Logitech) to avoid the same problem. But the mouse was becoming borderline unusable, so for the time being I borrowed a mouse from a less-often-used computer.

This mouse, an HP, worked fine for me for about 3 days and then â€“ guess what? â€“ it started experiencing the same two problems. At this point it was fair to wonder if the problem wasn't with the mice at all, so I decided to try my borderline-unusable mouse on the other computer. It seemed to work without problem (*note: based on subsequent developments, I should probably test that for a longer period, but haven't yet*).

My current status is that I use both mice. Each one seems to work fine when first plugged in; the HP one tends to go several hours before experiencing problems, the Logitech one maybe half an hour. But I'd really like to know what the problem is and whether it can be fixed.

Additional information:

* I have three USB ports and it doesn't matter which one they're plugged into.
* During the unresponsive periods, my computer is definitely aware that a mouse is plugged in, as evidenced by the fact that the touchpad is still disabled.
* I did firmware updates and nothing changed."
Compatible stylus/pen for Inspiron 7620?
"I'm not sure I can justify spending $50-60 on the official Dell pen for the touchscreen on my 2-in-1 laptop... Especially after reading so many people have problems with it. The rechargeable one is even more expensive.

I'm not 100% sure what digitizer technology the laptop has, but are there 3rd party cheaper pens? I had an older Dell Windows tablet with a 4th gen Intel CPU that had an active pen but it did nothing on this newer 12th gen laptop."

"Latitude 7420, WD19 dock, 4k TV won't push signal??"
"I've been using the built in display, a Dell 24"" monitor via hdmi, and a 22"" monitor via display port to dvi. All pushed through a (I think) WD19 dock connected via USB C to the laptop. Works as intended.

I just got a Samsung 40"" 4k TV (older 6 series model) to be the main monitor via hdmi. I want to run the TV via hdmi and the 24"" monitor via DP as dual displays and just leave the laptop closed.

It gets confused as hell and won't output correctly only sending signal to one or the other and sometimes neither. The working way right now is using the hdmi output from the laptop not the dock. But it won't push the 24"" via DP at all. It recognizes them with sound and shows 3 monitors in display settings (1 being built in). 

What am I missing here? I feel like it should be within the possibility to push them both via the dock, but it just doesn't work. Is it the dock? The cables?

Edit: finally working. I updated the dock firmware and went to the Dell website and used the driver update tool. 11 drivers needed updating. One being the display adapter. Works like it should now."

Dell 7577 BIOS downgrade and undervolt
"So I've been trying things out on how to downgrade my BIOS and this is how I downgraded it to 1.9.3 and have been able to undervolt again.

1. Get the BIOS you want to downgrade from dell's website (mine was 1.9.3)
2. Get another copy of the BIOS you want to downgrade to
3. Rename it to BIOS\_IMG.rcv and move it in your flash drive
4. Turn off your laptop
5. Remove everything that is connected to your laptop except for the flash drive
6. hold esc + ctrl then press the power button
7. once you get in the bios recovery, plug your AC back
8. do a rollback of your bios (mine became version 1.5)
9. once it restarts, press f2 to go in to bios settings and go to security and find the UFI capsule firmware update, untick the box and apply the settings
10. install the BIOS update that you've downloaded from dell (mine was 1.9.3)
11. go to bios recovery again (No. 6)
12. Reset BIOS settings
13. And finish, you now have downgraded your bios and able to undervolt your laptop

That's all the steps I've done to get it to 1.9.3 and be able to undervolt, I think you can skip the first parts but that's how I did mine. 

I don't know if this will mess with your laptop so do it at your own risk. Hope it helps!"

How's Dell's Precision QC?
"Just curious, I know there's been many complaints with QC issues on the latest generation of XPS 15 and 17. Does this translate to the Precision 5000 series as well? They share a lot of parts, but are also fairly different. I haven't really seen many complaints with the Precisions, though they do have a much smaller market with general consumers. 
I'd hope that Dell's highest end business laptops would have better and more consistent quality control.

I just ordered a Precision 5770 and I'm worried it might have the same issues as the XPS. I should get it today or tomorrow, so I guess I'll see."
XPS 13 9520 Died 10 days in
"When I initially booted it on arrival it complained that the system clock was not set.  It worked otherwise well for a week, though a full reboot after leaving overnight would result in the same system message.  About 10 days in I contacted Dell and they recommended a BIOS reset (I did it even though I had not changed anything significant).  The next morning, the same message so I ran the offered system diagnostic on the page.  After that it would not boot or charge.  An hour on the phone with them and it would only show the splash screen momentarily and the LED lit F keys were not lighting.  They used a key combo to diagnose a motherboard failure and are coming on tuesday so we will see.  I don't have a good feeling as last year I ordered an Alienware which also had a motherboard failure and the tech sent wasn't familiar with it and damaged the heat sink / cooler and I sent the whole system back.  Beautiful, powerful machine but don't they stress test these things before shipping them.  It showed a manufacture date back in October."

Question about daisy-chaining a U2518D and a U2520D.
"Hello,

I currently use a U2518D monitor on my pc and I plan to pair it with a U2520D in a couple of months. I really enjoy the 25"" + QHD combo, I've also read that the U2520D has an even better color quality than my own, and because of the thin bezel I'm sure the 2 monitors will look great together.

I know the U2520D has the ability to connect a second monitor through daisy-chaining, which would be great for minimizing cable clutter on my desk. However, I am uncertain about the specific cable and connection requirements for this setup. Would it be necessary to connect the U2520D to my PC using the provided USB-C cable? If so, do I require a motherboard that has a USB-C port at the back or could I use a USB-A to USB-C cable (or maybe a cheap adapter)? Is it possible to achieve the same result with only DisplayPort cables?

Thanks!"

Slightly noticeable vertical gray stripes on solid grey backgrounds
"When I ran built-in-diagnostics in my Dell **S2421HN IPS monitor**, and when it was on grey background during test, I noticed at least three subtle vertical stripes on screen. Not noticeable at all on any other color. Not noticeable on full white or dark background as well.

*However*, it's so faint that you might not even notice in images (I think when you see it live it's a bit more visible). So I have uploaded four photos [here](https://imgur.com/a/OiXAsKf). **Two are natural and two (yellow marked) are exaggerated versions (I used photoshop to highlight them more) of the same.**

Once you compare natural and exaggerated ones, you might even notice it. I thought it was during test only. But no, in fact it is noticeable to me on every app wherever there is similar grey backgrounds. *Slightly more noticeable* when I scroll anything horizontally. For example while working in Illustrator.

Dell Latitude 5320 Stylus Recommendations
"Hi. 

Apologies for another stylus recommendations post, I did search the group but there's not one specific for the Latitude 5320. I am seeking recommendations for a stylus.

Small laptop info: I can't quite figure out if my laptop is a 2-in-1 or standard 5320. This is a work laptop so I've not purchased it myself. The laptop is touch screen, and does fold over on itself so you can have just the screen facing out. Doing some googling I think I have the regular 5320, as the ports on those pictures match my laptop. So I guess I have the standard, but it's not confirmed.

I have tried my personal surface pen, and a staedtler noris digital stylus and both did not work. 

I am wanting to use the stylus for work, for note taking in OneNote. 

I can see I can get a dell branded stylus (premium active pen, or regular active pen) but I'm in Aus and they're wildly expensive. Hoping for a cheaper alternative. 

Thankyou!"

Precision 5530 (2018)
"What a waste of moneyâ€¦
I bought the P-5530 due to needing a laptop for graphic intensive work and school. 
The first year the laptop performance was ok. I honestly thought I bought better and â€œfuture proofedâ€ with what I did buy. 
Shortly after the first year the laptop began to make an unidentifiable grinding noise. 
I called into Dell Tech Support who ran all the same diagnostic tests that I did and no errors were found. I escalated the open ticket to tier 3 support as 1 and 2 couldnâ€™t do more than they did. I sent tier 3 audio/video of the laptop making the noise, they agreed that they could hear it, but could not decipher where the noise was coming from. Dell sent a tech out and they replaced the fan twice, and the motherboard once. However, the noise persisted. The next step was to send the laptop in to Dell to let their lab try to figure out what the problem is. Unfortunately, I could not send the laptop to Texas as I used the laptop every day for work, and school, and Dell does not offer a temporary replacement program. Dell could also not tell me how long my laptop would be in the lab and therefore no return date could be estimated. 
Iâ€™ve kept the laptop and dealt with the noise as it hasnâ€™t impacted the stability of the laptop, nor could I or can I afford a replacement. 

However, ever since installing Windows 11, the grinding noise has gotten worse, and system stability is awful. Iâ€™ve flattened/re-installed the OS at least 7 times prior to tonight. Tonight is the eighth attempt. 

Yes, the laptop is now old by 2023 standards. 
However, I thought I bought better than this. 

Dell has lost a fairly loyal customer and the point of this post is to keep others from making the same mistake that I did. 

Donâ€™t Buy Dell"

Precision 3561 Laptop won't charge via USB-C Thunderbolt Display LG 40wp95c that delivers 96W
"So I've a Dell Precision 3561 laptop and I just bought a LG 40WP95C monitor that comes with Thunderbolt 4 technology and USB-C Power delivery of 96W. Somehow, when the monitor is plugged in over either two Thunderbolt ports, the monitor  does not deliver any charge. It does provide power, as another laptop (different brand) does receive power with no issues.

I'm struggling to find the issue that might cause why the laptop is not receiving any charge (or is even blocking it on purpose).

In addition, the monitor only allows to be connected over USB-C/Thunderbolt when the original 130W charger is plugged in. If I plug in my older 90W charger, the monitor flickers on-off with a few seconds interval, each time. Connecting the monitor over Displayport with the same resolution/bitrate/refreshrate is no problem, even with or without the 90W charger. So somehow there seems to be an issue with the USB-C/Thunderbolt ports.

But I don't want to spend $$ on a mobo if the problem could be electrical ...any thoughts ?

\*\* Update \*\* 

Dug down into the RCA of the BSOD, customized specific event filter to drive better log analysis. Aka, Event Viewer --> Built Custom View --> Labeled it BSOD. See details below. Extracted VolMgr issues with Toshiba nvme drive. Even tried CHKDISK to mark bad blocks, BSODs continued. 

Since that time, I have swapped out the SSD (very very easy to do on this 9380) take that Apple (shakes fist). I swapped in the following. Just sharing for those that may have found this and unsure of how to shop. (No ego, been building computers for a VERY long time professional IT nerd here 27+ years) this unit from samsung got my vote, YMMV. Read more below

 [SAMSUNG 980 PRO SSD 1TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe Gen 4  Gaming M.2 ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GLX7TNT?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)

After swapping in the disk I used Macrium Reflect Free since this is for personal use, imaged the whole disk (including partitions with the free software to a large USB 3 (usb-C adapter used). Very easy steps:

1. Download Macrium, share email to get registration key
2. Build rescue iso someplace on windows local disk \~700MB use you should have room for this
3. Use rufus to build bootable (find large USB thumb drive 256GB or greater)
4. Once rufus has ""imaged the thumbdrive"" boot into winders
5. Make backup with Macrium to a new folder on thumb drive that was used for rescue build. I named the folder images ... makes sense.
6. Once done, shutdown unit (like no seriously power down the unit via OS NOT SLEEP MODE)
7. Follow this very easy video on how to swap out 9380 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqjbHuWy6lc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqjbHuWy6lc) you'll need a T5 torx and plastic trim tool at a minimum make sure you disconnect battery and reconnect, no shortcuts here folks you could perma damage your unit.
8. Test boot with plate off (careful handling yeah) once validated hard power down with long press on power button
9. Button the plate back on. Plug prepped thumbdrive, power on spamming F12, select usb drive..... 
10. The rest should be easy also make sure to extend your volume. Macrium has some good step by step process in their docs or on youtube. 
11. 9380 now has a 1TB samsung (read quality drive... no thanks toshiba)
12. So far so good. Will come back later as time goes with this semi-refreshed 9380.

Dell Inspiron 5Ghz WiFi Issue Solved
"I recently bought the Dell Inspiron 3525 RYZEN 5 5625U. I was having hard time connecting to the 5Ghz network for the first time. I searched in the internet and found many others facing the same issue. They all suggested basically to update the driver and all. Didn't actually find any proper solution. The problem was mainly  with the IEEE802.11d turned on.  IEEE 802.11d  faciliates the development of wireless local area network (WLAN) devices that compy with the wireless communications regulations of their respective countries. It was basically interfearing for the region regulation stuffs. Then I disabled it and the 5Ghz band was connected right then. 

To do that, first you have to go the device manager > Network Adapters > right click on the network adapter > properties > Advanced Tab > 802.11d value set to disabled. That's it. 
Have a good day.."

How to restore my XPS 15 9500 to out of the box state after changing the SSD ?
"Hello everyone,

I had to change my SSD and I reinstalled a fresh Windows 10 using the OS recovery tool but after installing, I am missing most of Dell tools and drivers which I expected to be installed back automatically.

Is there a way to do it? Or am I doomed to make a manual install of everything?"

"""Intel ARC Control"" and ""Intel Graphics Command Center Startup Task"""
"I have a Dell Inspiron13 5310 running Windows 10.  I do not use it for gaming.

After a power up or restart I am asked to allow Intel ARC Control to make changes to my pc.  If I allow it, an application then runs that gives me a hardware status dashboard and it also takes about 10+ % of memory (as seen from the task manager).

I looked in startup tab of the task manager and see that both ""Intel Arc Control"" and  ""Intel Graphics Command Center Startup Task""  are both enabled for Startup.

Do I need either one of these to run at startup?

Thanks in advance."

M4800 Slow performance
"Apparently there was an issue with SpeedStep (power saving cpu clock adj.) according to...

https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-ie/000136338/slow-performance-on-the-precision-m4800-with-intel-speedstep-enabled

But I am curious about the confusion between cores and threads in MSCONFIG which shows 4 cores for an I5-4340M. This is what should be selected?

I'm also confused about SSD options for an M4800. I'm thinking there are four different ways to add an SSD? If you do add an SSD is there a safe process for duplicating Win10 onto it?

Thanks."
NEVER EVER TOUCHING DELL PRODUCTS
"These people have the worst support services I have EVER seen. They openly committed fraud with me and do not want to resolve anything, 3 years ago I called to sign up for warranty on my pc the guy who was signing me up never said nothing of me not being able to cancel the warranty but thats not the case, he literally signed me up for an instalment loan to buy their warranty just so he can get commission. You would think i would know because of the contract they send BUT NO THIS IDIOT SENT THE CONTRACT TO THE WRONG EMAIL AND FOR 3 YEARS I BEEN PAYING FOR A LOAN. 


I called them today explaining that your employee committed fraud using my name to sign me up for a loan i never agreed on, and that i was never able to see this contract as you can see the email on the contract (I requested them to send me the contract a day prior) doesnâ€™t match the one you guys have on file for me, and all they said was â€œsorry sir we cannot help you as you wanted warrantyâ€. Im so disgusted with this company NEVER EVER TOUCHING THESE PRODUCTS AGAIN. 

Does anyone know who to contact for issues like this? Legal issues? Cause the kept me on the phone for 3 hours switching around to different 3rd world country departments."

Which one of the two should I choose: XPS 15 or G15?
"I'm currently looking for a laptop that's good for video and photo editing, as well as dabbling into a little bit of gaming. I considered the XPS, however, I read that the G15 is better for gaming and is also cheaper, and is good/great for video editing. Because of this, I'm now unsure which one to choose. Iâ€™m not a big gamer, yet, gaming laptops tend to be more powerful and expensive but the G15 is cheaper and has more horsepower than the XPS. Because of this, Iâ€™m now a bit stuck and would love your advice regarding this situation"

Issues in Alienware m17 R5 and Warranty Extension US/India
"**Context:**

I purchased a new Dell Alienware M17 R5 system in November 2022 in the US. It had hardware issues from the minute I got it. As I had to leave for India soon, given the premium support policy and 30 day replacement policy, I decided to take it up in India Geo. 

Even after being promised a system replacement initially, I was denied the same from both India and US teams and only provided an option of refurbished part replacement. Given its a ridiculously expensive system, I am at least trying to get a warranty extension. Again I am being denied a NBD Accidental warranty. 

I got a 4 year same warranty on my previous Dell machine for INR 6499. However, now the ""premium support+"" warranty price for 3 years is being quoted is INR 59999 (approx 60% of laptop's total price). I am unsure what warrants a 10 times in price? They're mentioning that only Premium support and premium support plus are available for Alienware systems.

**Questions:**

1. Any experience of cheaper Alienware warranty for India location systems? Is there something the can be done to get a reasonably priced warranty extension? I've already changed the location from US to India. It is available as a model in India Geo according to tech support.
2.  This is my 1st Alienware machine. How long do these machines usually last? Suggestions on whether I should get a warranty no matter how ridiculously overpriced it is?"
Dell G7 Issues
Hello! I recently purchased a g7 15 about 2 years ago and all of a sudden recently itâ€™s been overheating easily and giving me the blue screen of death no matter what game I play (if played for a longer period of time). Iâ€™m always constantly unplugging the power source because I noticed it doesnâ€™t overheat when unplugged. Iâ€™ve been getting the blue screen that says â€œFaulty hardware corrupted pageâ€ or â€œsystem service exceptionâ€. Iâ€™m fairly new to having a gaming laptop and I donâ€™t know if my drivers are outdated and I personally donâ€™t know how to fix them if thatâ€™s the case. Please help :(

New Inspiron Laptop - Thunderbolt
"Hi all, just purchased a new Dell Inspiron laptop after going years without a personal PC.  Itâ€™s on the cheaper end (under $500 on Amazon) but I donâ€™t anticipate needed it too much.  

The only issue is this model doesnâ€™t look to have a Thunderbolt 4 connector, which is what I plug into my work computer to use my monitor, keyboard, etc.   I was really hoping to leverage that equipment for personal use, but the dock uses a thunderbolt connector.  

Is there some sort of adapter that could convert the thunderbolt end into HDMI so I can plug it into my personal computer and use my work accessories?  Everything on Amazon looks to be the opposite - converting HDMI to thunderbolt.  

Not sure how meaningful but the dock is also a Dell product.  It has another thunderbolt port, which I could maybe run a thunderbolt to HDMI cable out of, but not sure if that will work to link my personal PC to the dock.  

Really appreciate any thoughts/insights.  Hoping I donâ€™t have to return the entire computer, because the main intent was to use my work station. 

Thanks!"

Dell Power Bank Problem
"I used the PH45W17-BA - 45W AC Adapter + Notebook Power Bank to charge my Inspiron 5491 2n1 laptop. When I used the power provider portal for the laptop, it charged for a little bit over an hour. The laptop notified me that it requires at least 65 W so it took longer to charge. As a result, it stopped charging the laptop after 85%. At the same time, I was charging my phone and it stopped charging at 75%. Soon, the power bank died. If I charge the laptop using its USB-C portal, will the same thing happen? Otherwise, will it only provide a one time charge?"

Gifted Inspiron 17 7773 series wonâ€™t recognise the AC charger it comes with
"I was excited to be given a Dell 17 2-in-1 by someone and I put Pop!_OS on it. When I boot I get a warning that itâ€™s not recognising the AC charger and the battery is slowly draining away. Battery was always at 2%. I bought a new battery and it came to my house at 43% but it wonâ€™t charge. Battery health is â€œexcellentâ€. Good. It cost me forty quid. What should I do? 

The forums all say these AC chargers break. Why would one design some system to â€œcheck your got the right chargerâ€. All my Lenovos work with each otherâ€™s chargers. Of course they do. Everyone else uses Usb-C. 

This is rubbish. Is it anything to do with the ridiculously fragile central wire in the charger? That looks built to break. Is this a known issue?

Edit: I am using the USB-C socket and itâ€™s charging. Meh."

How i fixed Dell G7 7590 (Rtx 2060 80 Watt) thermal issues and increase performance.
"How i fixed the thermal and overheating issue? Its simple. Liquid metal. Before applying it, i did extensive research and was very careful. Thankfully, Dell has protected the GPU amd CPU with black tape so no fear of spilling or anything. Also i only applied it to the cpu and simple thermal paste to the gpu. Also i applied -0.150 undervolt to the core and cache using throttlestop and limit PL1 and Pl2 to 60W.

Results of 5 minutes XTU cpu stress test:

Before :

CPU max temp : 96 degrees

GPU max temp: 74 degrees

After :

CPU max temp : 69 degrees

GPU max temp: 69 degrees

Huge improvement and no throttling of any kind and fans dont run as fast

Onto increasing performance. Because of improved thermals, i applied +235 Mhz overclock to GPU core and +715 Mhz overclock to GPU memory clock. Also i flashed 90W vbios using nvflash.

Before:

3dmark time spy: 6432

Shadow of tomb raider highest setting benchmark : 84 fps

Passmark GPU test : 11353

After:

3dmark time spy: 6942

Shadow of tomb raider highest setting benchmark : 91 fps

Passmark GPU test : 14035

Maximum CPU and GPU temp remains 72 degree celcius. 69 degree celcius max if ultra performance is selected in dell power manager which makes fans runs at max speed of 5000 rpm. It makes more noise though."

Precision 3570 - Downgrading Restricted BIOS
"Hello all,

The Precision 3570 released a BIOS version (1.8.2) recently that now restricts any downgrading to previous versions. The issue is that I have an image on an old Windows build that requires BIOS version 1.1.1. I understand that I will need to upgrade this image, but I need more time before that is ready. Is anyone aware of ideas how to bypass the restriction placed by Dell? So far, I have tried these steps below:

1. Incremental downgrade. Issue is that there is a hard stop at 1.8.2, so even attempting 1.7.0 will fail.
2. Dell BIOS Recovery
   1. Rename ""Precision\_3570\_Latitude\_5530\_1.10.0.exe"" to BIOS\_IMG.rcv
   2. Copy to FAT32 USB
   3. Hold Ctrl+ESC key until BIOS recovery screen displays... After starting firmware downgrade, received same error ""BIOS Update blocked due to unsupported downgrade""
3. Rufus FreeDOS, issue is that Legacy is not supported on this model. ( [BIOS update blocked due to unsupported downgrade, #2 - Dell Community](https://www.dell.com/community/Inspiron/BIOS-update-blocked-due-to-unsupported-downgrade-2/td-p/7526850) )

If anyone has any ideas, well appreciated.

Did the 2018 version of 7390 laptop lack an accessible RAM slot?
"Pretty sure I know the disappointing answer here but my Dell 7390, purchased in 2018, has 16 GB of RAM which shows up in the Crucial Memory Scanner as 2 x 8 GB. I opened it up thinking one was accessible and might accept a 16 GB chip, but what I see when I open it (1st pic) is very different from what I see from YT videos of the same model. Since these videos are more recent I'm thinking that the design changed to make one slot accessible.

I don't mind opening up the laptop further if there's a ram slot on the other side of the board, or perhaps under the black cover in the top right corner of the picture, but I haven't seen any reason to think there is. Anyone happen to have found a way to access RAM in the MB configuration shown there?

Dell regional differences
"Just as the title suggested, I found that some laptop configurations is only available in certain regions in the world. Iâ€™m in Singapore and I just bought a XPS 13 plus with a i7-1260p processor. I actually want a 1280p because I really want super expensive laptops like this be more future-ready and hopefully I donâ€™t need to buy a new one for 5 years or more. But unfortunately I can only get up to 1260p for XPS 13 plus in Dell Singapore website. However I accidentally find out that 1280p version is available on America, Canada and Germany websites. I guess that means only North America and Europe have the full laptop configuration options.

Inspiron 3670 - adding m2 ssd
"Iâ€™d like to add an m2 ssd drive to my Inspiron 3670 computer.  I have a couple of questions.  

1.  The manual says it cant be larger than 500gb.  Is that correct?  Iâ€™m not sure why size matters here.

2.  Do I need to purchase a screw to fasten the m2 drive into the motherboard?  Iâ€™ve read that there is a standoff, but I canâ€™t tell about the screw to hold the drive down.  

3.  How likely is a rookie going to be at installing windows, etc.., and cloning my old HDD to the new ssd?

Thank you!"
Used Latitude 5520 arrived without Bluetooth?
"Just got a used Dell Latitude 5520 off eBay and it arrived without the ability to connect to Bluetooth. No tab in the action center and no Bluetooth in device manager. When I run the Bluetooth troubleshooter, it tells me that ""Bluetooth is not available on this device"" but according to the online specs, the wireless module I have should support Bluetooth.

I've reinstalled Windows 10, updated the drivers, turned on Bluetooth services under services.msc. Nothing has made a difference. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Dell Optiplex 7010 - No Startup-Screen
"Hi together,

last week I received a Dell Optiplex 7010 for free in some kind of store closure. The only thing missing in it was the harddrive. 

So far I've tried to start it up, but I only get ""No Signal Input"" on my screen. It doesn't matter if I connect it via VGA or Displayport, the outcome is always the same. I tried booting it with and without a drive, but it didn't change. It does start however as you can hear the fans start and also some LEDs are flashing yet there is no screen output only black screen.

Since I haven't disassembled it fully yet I don't know what kind of CPU it has but the RAM is: HMT451U6AFR8C-PB - SK Hynix 4GB DDR3-1600 UDIMM PC3-12800U Single Rank x8 Module.

Any help is appreciated."

Dell 5290 2in1 stylus compatibility
Hi everyone - one quick question. I have Dell 5290 2in1 and was looking for stylus. From Dell portfolio only Active Pen PN557W seems to work with this device. In my area it's non-available or pretty expensive. Since it is using Wacom AES 1.0 protocole does this mean I can use any device with Wacom AES 1.0 or 2.0 (e.g. Wacom Bamboo Ink) and will be able to use all fuctions of touchscreen? Or is the device locked to work only with Dell stylus?

Updating drivers and BIOS

RAM Change Help
I have 2 laptops Inspiron 5520 and Inspiron 3443. There is 6gb ram on 5520 but 4 gb on 3443. I don't use inspiron 5520 anymore because it has display issues. I want to put the 6gb of 5520 on 3443. But i am not really sure if the 6gb will make the laptop faster as Inspiron 5520 is relatively older than Inspiron 3443. So i am not sure if the speed due to extra 2gb of RAM minus less speed due to older RAM will be better than using relatively newer 4gb of RAM as I have to sacrifice 4gb to put 6gb as there is no extra slot. What do you guys say?

This only happens with USB-C but not through the Adapter.

I have one output on the hdmi out as well as one out the DP alt usbc port. I have not tried using a DP cable yet.

My laptop will only detect the hdmi screen but not the other screen. It also doesnâ€™t register the usb devices connected to the dock(keyboard + mouse)

If I use my work laptop, a dell precision 5530, 0 issue with screen and usb recognition.

if i run an hdmi seperately from the laptop to the monitor, the dock registers the usb devices."
Dell Inspiron 5680 Monitor no display
"So on christmas I received a used Dell Inspiron 5680 from my father. He got it from his office and he planned to give it to me when he comes back home. FFWD he arrives and he boots up the pc, it went to bios and it seemed like it was working fine. I didn't use it for awhile so after we boot it up I just left it in my room, I didn't set it up or anything so it just stayed in my room for the duration of December. January though, I was able to move out my pc and everything was set up. So I boot up the pc again but this time the monitor just had this message ""Entering power save mode"" and the monitor completely shuts down. I've tried everything like reseating the cpu, cleaning the ram, and taking out the cmos battery but to no avail, the monitor still wont display anything. What might be the problem?"

Adding HDMI Out to Optiplex 7070 SFF - what P/N and have you done it?
Just finished setting up my new XPS-13 9315 and populating it with my data files. Iâ€™m impressed
"First, this thing looks elegant. I went with the Umber color and I do not regret my choice.

Almost no bloatware from Dell. I didnâ€™t even have to uninstall McAfee because it didnâ€™t come installed in the first place. The only apps from Dell are My Dell, Support Assist and Dell Update.

Got it with Core i7, 32GB of RAM and 1TB of SSD. Went non-touch because I still find touchscreens on laptops and desktops extremely pointless. Performance is as good as I was hoping for, once all the indexing was done. Audio is loud and clear, though light on the bass. Video quality impressed me too. I thought I was going to feel the downgrade of switching from an ASUS VivoBook with OLED to an IPS screen but the XPSâ€™ screen looks nice, especially with the reduced bezels. And no â€œnose hair webcamâ€ unlike my Dell laptop from work. No complaints about the keyboard or the touchpad either.

The only types of user I wouldnâ€™t recommend the XPS 9315 for are video producers and gamers. But this little laptop packs a good punch for pretty much everybody else."
Recovery Partitions No Longer Labeled as Such
"I have an old Dell OptiPlex 3050 and replaced the stock 500G HDD with a 1TB SSD.  I used a Windows 10 install USB and a system recovery image to essentially ""move"" everything over.  Everything worked great, and all four stock partitions were created/restored on the new SSD (EFI System, Boot/Page/etc, and three ""Recovery Partition"").

Since the new drive is 1 TB, that left about 500GB un-allocated. I had to use a 3rd party partitioner to merge the unallocated space with the OS drive since Windows would not do it as they were not next to each other.

Everything went fine, but now the three recovery partitions are no longer labeled in Disk Management:

&#x200B;

[Before Merge](https://preview.redd.it/7placqk8uhda1.png?width=526&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b1f1ec5fd76486876b9eb4660a7f21bba8e27750)

Are these useless now? I no longer have any space labeled as ""Recovery Partition"". Can I delete them and merge them all into the OS drive? Everything seems to be working fine, and I do not really care about any ""Dell Recovery"", but I do not want to mess anything up Windows-wise. Unfortunately, a clean install was not an option right now, although I may just do that in the future.

Thanks."

Optiplex 7060 Micro - Detach from a corporate account - Unknown Power Supply response with OEM PS
"Hi there,

I bought an Optiplex 7060 Micro from a pawn shop, as is, for $40 over the weekend. They *suddenly* couldn't find the power supply, so I ordered an OEM one from Amazon. (It appears to be genuine, but it still gives a power adapter error on boot.)

It'd be a great little machine, perfect for what I need it to do, if I could actually logon to Windows on it. The thing is locked to Progressive Insurance. I've tried wiping the installed drive with diskpart before installing Windows 10 and deleting all the partitions during the install, but to no avail.

It has BIOS v 1.2.22 and no passwords. There's no service tag found on Dell's site, so methinks the pawn shop bought technically stolen, but not *reported* as stolen property.

Is the serial of the PC somehow tied to Progressive via Azure or something? I cannot create a local account and proceeding past that login screen is impossible without a network connection.

Is there any hope for this thing?"

Second thing, the plug starter falling apart right from the beginning. The cable's sheath slowly pulled itself backwards and off the plug, the the plug was naked and broke.

I certainly don't want to put 40â‚¬ plus shipping in a spare charger. I'd like to know if the barrel plug is any kind of special and has any particularity. Where can I get the proper one to replace the old broken plug ?

Then connect the upstream 90w USB-C port to the surface and connect the second upstream USB-C to the Mac mini and run all peripherals thru those two upstream so both machines can access the two monitors, keyboard/mouse and the webcam?

1. Format a USB drive using Rufus (select Grub 2.06 as startup type)
2. Make a folder called EFI in the root of the USB
3. Inside this, make a folder called BOOT
4. Download [this](https://github.com/datasone/grub-mod-setup_var/releases/download/1.4/modGRUBShell.efi) file and place it inside BOOT
5. Rename this file to bootx64.efi
6. Boot into the USB drive as UEFI boot, not legacy (spam F12 at the BIOS prompt and select your USB drive)
7. Once this has loaded, enter **setup\_var\_3  0x659 0x00** to disable overclocking lock
8. Repeat this with **setup\_var\_3 0x5BD 0x00** to disable CFG lock
9. Enter  **setup\_var 0x664 0x1**  to  Set Core Voltage Offset Prefix to Negative

"Monitors Periodically Blinking/Blanking Off using Dell Laptop, Docking Station, Dual Monitors"
"&#x200B;

**Problem:** Every so often one or both of my external monitors will go blank. They stay blank for 1 to 2 seconds, then come back on. It can be an hour or more between or it can happen a few times in a row within the space of one minute.

&#x200B;

**Setup:** This is happening on multiple Dell laptops with multiple monitors, in multiple locations. 

I first noticed it at work where they provided me with a Dell Latitude 7430 and a Dell Thunderbolt WD22TB4 docking station. There I have two external monitors, both Dell 23"".

Then I bought my own WD22TB4 Docking station for home. Using the same Latitude 7430 but the home docking station and my own monitors (and, obviously, different cables) -- it still happens. The home monitors are a 24"" Dell and a Samsung TV acting as a monitor. Never had a problem with the Samsung as a monitor before.

Then I also bought a THIRD WD22TB4 to use with my own personal laptop (Dell Inspiron 7579). That one, at home, is connected via a KVM switch to the same two home monitors (Dell 24"" + Samsung). Same thing happens on that.

&#x200B;

**Things I've Tried / More Info:** I've worked with both my company's Help Desk and with Dell technical support. We've updated the graphics card drivers on each of the laptops. We've updated the BIOS in each of the three docking stations. We've checked the power-use settings.

This weekend I also bought and installed an ANKER brand docking station and tried that. It continues to happen -- same problem -- so I guess it might be in the laptops, not the docking stations (?)

&#x200B;

**Interesting to Note:** It does ***not*** seem to happen with my much older (2016) Dell Inspiron 7579. That computer has a different graphics card (built in) than all the newer Dells. So maybe it's a graphics card issue. -- Oh, and if I plug one of the monitors directly into one of the latops (not via the dock) the problem ***does*** persist on the dock-connected monitor but ***does not persist*** on the directly connected monitor.

&#x200B;

**Other People:** A coworker says the same thing used to happen on his work setup (Dell laptop, dual monitors, Dell docking stations) but has recently stopped happening. He doesn't know why. -- Both Dell Support and my company's Help Desk say they have never heard of this before. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Any ideas? Is this happening to anyone else's setup?**"

Couple months ago I posted how I couldnâ€™t get my Inspiron 9100 to charge but now I have a new problem

XPS 17 9720 - Extremely low max volume after update
"At my wits end here, been struggling trying to fix this for over 2 hours with absolutely no luck. I updated to the newest version of Windows 11 a few months ago and it completely disabled all sound from my device. The outputs would still show up and I could still use the volume slider but no matter what I did, there was no sound at all. I eventually just reverted the update. Now, earlier today I thought I might as well try the newest update to see if that fixed anything. I am able to get sound out of my speakers now, but my headphone jacks maximum output is like 5% compared to what I had before. However, reverting the Windows update this time did not undo the problem. I've tried running the troubleshooter, disabling and updating all the drivers in device manager, downloading individual drivers from Dells website, enabling and disable Audio Enhancements, installing and uninstalling Waves MaxxAudio and nothing's working.

Problem with Dell Advantage and Dell Support
Dell Optiplex 5000 mini display port
"New IT guy at a company and we are over halfway through rolling out Dell optiplex minis to around 50 users. We are currently using vga to display port with the use of vga to dp adapters. One user with a 5000 mini seems to be having issues with his monitors. Two separate times his computer boots up but won't display to his monitors. When I bring his pc back to the workstation area it displays fine to my monitor. This last time I tried switching to a straight vga to dp cord without an adapter and nothing. After swapping out one monitor, the new monitor works and swapping back to his old acer monitor he was using it works again on those. I'm anticipating the same issue to come up again. I've seen the optiplex 5000 mini has had issues with display ports but when I set up a new 7000 mini at his desk that doesn't work either. Is this a case of a bad monitor or has anyone else had similar issues?"

Dell Inspiron 3670 Desktop Date and Time error when power lost
"Iâ€™ve been working on a Dell Inspiron 3670 desktop with an 8th Gen Intel i5 processor. For some strange reason, I get an error at startup if the power has been lost to the computer. It says â€œDate and Time not Setâ€ and also something about invalid settings. This is before booting into Windows as it gives me options to go into the BIOS.

Yes the CMOS battery has been replaced, as the old one was absolutely dead. I did make sure the new battery is good (measured 3.05 volts), and that it is seated properly in its slot.

Dell inspiron 15 3511 battery percentage doesn't go up while charging.
"My laptop isn't going up in charge while charging. If plugged, it says its charging but the battery is neither going up not down.  
  
Notes:  
  
I havn't done anything suspicious except pulling the cable from the outlet while the cable is still connected to the laptop. I suspect this move is what bricked it or something  
  
Another note is, there is a white LED beside where you connect the cable to the laptop. It's supposed to be ON when the laptop is charging (unless if the laptop reached 100%). However this time it never turns on indicating it isnt charging the battery. Though it turns for a sec if I plug it in thr laptop. My understanding is that the laptop is thinking that the laptop is all the time fully charged but it isnt.  
  
Also, if I plug out and then I plug the cable in the laptop I hear very very dim whistling or humming.  
  
Laptop is currently stuck at 60%, and I am trying not to use it plugged off so I don't waste any remaining charge   
  
Any help is appreciated, thanks  
  
Edit: my power limit is set to 90% so it cant charge more than 90%, but I doubt this has anything to do with this"

I have a Dell XPS 15 9500 that I bought roughly 2.5 years ago and am already facing some battery issue with it wherein I cannot use it without connecting it to the power source and it behaves like the battery simply isn't there. Dell is asking me to pay for a battery replacement as the battery warranty is only 1 year. I don't understand the point of purchasing such a laptop if 'wear and tear' (Dell service's words) can occur so quickly? Is there an email address I can write to regarding this? I appreciate any help.
Compatible bluray drives for Dell 5040 SFF?

I have 12.7mm drive, but won't fit in the dvd holder.

Having a hard time finding decently priced slimmer ones.

I have seen some Dell branded ones, but hard to check if they're 9.5mm or 12.7mm."

Dell Inspiron 5491 2n1 Battery Performance

Buying Advice
We own an XPS 8900 with 64gb of memory and a 4tb solid state hard drive. We have been upgrading over time but are looking at a new machine. We want a machine we can use for a small server to deliver SQL and image files to the network here with just three workstations. It should be very fast but not high-end. Our budgets are usually modest around here. Any recommendations for a computer that will process information faster than our i7-6700 3.40GHz 4 core machine?
Inspiron 16 plus terrible performance while gaming
"The laptop performs poorly if I try to game on it plus the fan noise is insane. I have inspiron 16 plus 7520 ryx 3050 4b and i7 12th gen and its getting barely 30fps on Witcher 3 even if I put it on low settings, some games are straight up getting 1-10fps, even Doom Eternal the most optimized pc game ever made is not running smooth on this laptop. I have even tried switching to ultra performance mode and still the same result. Should I return this model for replacement or get a different laptop altogether"
Dell XPS screen broke :(
" 

So I emailed Dell about several issues I was having with my laptop including a hinge problem when my laptop was under warranty. They responded but recommended only software solutions. They then emailed to confirm solution but I couldn't get back to them as I was abroad and thus they close the request. The warranty then ended and my laptop's hinge was coming loose. I took it to an IT repair centre to fix it but they didn't finish the job and made it worse. When I opened the laptop, it wouldn't close as the hinges were fully out and bending against the screen. A few moments later the screen broke and there were lines all across it. My question is would there be any chance Dell would repair this for free if I emailed them. Or could I buy warranty for it and request them to fix it - I would feel bad about doing this if it was my fault it broke but it wasn't. Thanks

Tldr: Could I buy warranty and ask dell to fix my laptop?"
What happened to XPS 9500?
"This was the most beautiful machine on planet earth at the time of its release. The OG Linus even said this is the best windows laptop ever. 

I bought mine a year ago, and even though the looks still blow almost every laptop (except maybe the new MBs) out of water, speakers are killer and the screen is great, it is not as snappy as it used to be. It overheats (which it did not used to) and it just doesn't feel as responsive. I know that the machine is about to be 3 years old but goddamn, this was the chosen one."

Laptop casing separating
"Hello,

&#x200B;

I have a Dell 9570 Laptop and am having an issue with the outside casing separating. It makes itself known whenever opening the laptop. There is a loud crunching sound. I'm not 100% sure if something is getting damaged or it's just loud because it's metal against metal. This has been going on for a few months now, so I know failure isn't imminent, but Im sure something is getting worn away, and eventually I will have problems.

&#x200B;

Here is what happens hallways through opening:

At other times, everything is closed together.

So annoying that Dell decided to drop the standard rear speaker jack on current generation Optiplexes
"Been ordering Optiplexes for my customers for over 10 years. They always included a rear speaker jack. Imagine my surprise when I ordered some new 3000 series Optiplex SFF's only to find Dell cheaped out and no longer puts a rear speaker port on them. Sure it has a front port but I don't like connectors that stay permanently connected hanging out the front. 

That also applies to USB ports. Prefer more USB ports in the back and less in the front. Whoreally needs 4 USB's on the front. Just looks cluttered with 4 UB devices plugged iin. Bet Dell will probably go to 6 in front and 2 in back in the next version of the Optiplex for all we know. ðŸ™„"
My Inspiron 5593 battery won't charge.
"Why won't my Dell Inspiron 5593 charge?  When I plug it in, the charging light comes on white for four seconds and then shuts off.  I just replaced the battery because the old one wouldn't charge either.  I assumed it was a bad battery.  The computer powers up and runs plugged in, and it recognizes the battery in Device Manager.  I've uninstalled/reinstalled the driver.  It seems like the computer thinks the battery is fully charged, so it doesn't charge it and shuts off the charging light."

Upgrading a Vostro 3700
"Hello everyone,

I own an old Vostro 17"" 3700 Laptop that I would like to upgrade instead of replacing it (it's for casual usage : web browsing, e-mail,... It already does that but is really slow).

I've upgraded several old computers already, but this one is a bit more tricky. Indeed, for an unknown reason, Dell shipped it with Windows 7 Pro 32 bits. The thing is it has a 64 bits CPU so I'm a bit surprised. I have installed 4GB of RAM instead of the stock 3GB but given it has a 32 bits OS it can only use 3GB. Here are the complete specs:

Dell Vostro 3700 - Windows 7 Pro 32 bits SP1
I3 M370 2,40GHz (64 bits CPU) 
4,00 Go RAM (2,93 usable because of the 32 bits OS)
HDD 320Go

My idea is to replace the HDD by a SSD and then install Windows 10 pro 64 bits on it, which should unlock the 4Go of RAM. Is this possible or should I check something else first?

Thanks in advance for your help! 

EDIT: last question : can I use my Windows 7 pro license or will it lock me to the 32 bits version of Windows 10?"

PowerEdge T620 / Weird Behavior with iDRAC
"Hi,

I think I screwed up my iDRAC by blowing air in my T620 and now I am trying to use the recovery method (https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-ca/000120131/poweredge-idrac-recovery-procedure-with-firmimg-d7) However, there's no indication of whether to do this powered on or off.

So, I got a weird behavior that after 2 reboots trying to initialize the iDRAC, the monitor goes to sleep, the LCD turns on but blank, and nothing else moves for like 5min, then it goes to the POST with ""Lifecycle Controller Disabled"".

I tried resetting with the ID button, does nothing. Tried flea power thing, didn't do anything either.

Any ideas? Or will I have a server for parts? (Not gonna replace the MB, it's 500$US, I paid less than that for the server.)"
very frustrated with desktop PSU noise repair
"Not sure if anyone has such frustrating experience as me.

got a new XPS 8950 desktop and soon heard sort of vibration noise. ran diagnostic test and seemed front/rear fans were ok but no test for PSU fan.

Mentioned these concerns and the on-line CSR ordered a part. when the on-site tech came and found it's rear fan, and he figured it out that the noise is from PSU. so he requested the PSU/fan.

a week later, he called and said he received the  fan, BUT NOT the PSU fan he ordered. he suggested to send the unit back to Dell depot where a thorough test can be done to guarantee that it'll be fixed. that sounded ok. so shipped the computer to Dell.

the nightmare came.

status showed a diagnosis was done, BUT the part is out of stock. I need to wait about 2 weeks. soon it's updated that 3 weeks are need to get the part.

talked to Dell CSR and asked if possible to return the computer back to me and then have on-site tech install the part when available. they politely refused. and never told me what part is in back order.

so can't do any work for a few weeks when the computer sits in dell's facility. it's unbelievable that it's take 3 weeks for a part as this model is still available for sale at Dell. and they even don't want to find an alternative way to minimize impact on customers.

really frustrated as I trusted dell's quality and service when ordered this computer."

Cheapest Netbook/Chromebook style 12inch Thinkpad? (second hand)
"&#x200B;

Good Morning everyone :)!

I am looking for a small laptop/ultrabook to use with a minimal Debian distro for general web browsing, libre office, mail, some Youtube/Netflix content 720p/1080p or just whatever resolution matter for that display size. I will also write and I'm looking for an awesome typing experience.  
That's it!  
Are there any thinkpad models, which could have the chassis of a chromebook or a netbook, that are suited to this scenario?

Detailed Requirements:

\- Fanless. Or Fan must have sensors in order to be able to set low, or none, RPM speed from Linux software.  
\- Display size should be below 13 inches, 12.5 or less would be perfect. IPS or FlickerFree display. (No PWM). sRGB coverage >50%.  
\- SSD, Ram, and other components upgradability options would be awesome. Should not be bulky. It would be awesome if it could have HDMI, USB-A, USB-C, SD/MicroSDCard and other ports.  
\- USB-C charger, or at least, should be small, like those of smartphone. [Not like this](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mjJHB7j1L.jpg)  
\- Second hand buy budget around 150/200â‚¬"

Dell G5 5587 Hinge/Bezel Issue
"I've had this laptop since summer 2019, I use it pretty much daily and open and close it a few times a day, almost always from the middle. As people are aware this along with the G3 have an issue with the hinge thay causes it to get more and more stuck over time and eventually this causes the bezel to separate from the screen. 

That's what has happened to mine. At this point the screen still works but the separation is very significant and it's very difficult to open and close the lid, to the point I've stopped doing it and just leave it open. 

What I want to do is expose the hinges enough that I can loosen them a bit, I removed the back case, and the bottom vent which exposes the hinge a bit but it's still a hit blocked by the piece on either corner of the laptop. Is there a tool I can use to access the hinge with this much exposure? I would rather not deshell the whole thing if I can avoid it. 

At this point I'm okay to just use it at home and connect it to my TV which is the main use I have for it anyway.

If anyone has some insight to this it would be greatly appreciated.

Obviously out of warranty and I'm not in the original country of purchase."

So now I have a laptop blaring away in a throttled state with 13c of headroom to spare. It will also throttle the cpu down to 70c and never budge. I know these can easily hit 100c within spec, why am I capped at 70 with low clocks? What A piece of shit, I'm sick of this laptop."

After that, the laptop would not recognize its regular charger (90W), saying it was low power.

I'm wondering if this could be what is causing the TB16 to not charge the laptop.  Maybe it is looking for a stronger power source?

Has anyone had this issue and found a solution...other than using the TB16 for target practice? :P"

Dell 3020 under warranty still stuck at Dell screen
"Any help appreciated. I'm bringing it into Microcenter tomorrow, but it's a second trip, so in the back of my head, I know that, even before the 2 years are up, it could end up being a problem that's never fixed. It's a refurbished unit, and I put a low-profile graphics card in.  So far, since I got it back it was working fine, Lubuntu humming along. Then I rebooted and it got stuck on the Dell screen again. So, remembering a Youtube video where a guy took out a RAM stick and it booted up again, I thought, ""MAYBE because the graphics card is in, that could be confusing the motherboard or the boot process"" so I took it out. Worked fine for 3 boot-ups, and then the last time, when I booted it up, stuck again. I'm not smart enough to figure out what it could be...are there viruses out there that make it so that you can't boot up your computer, could it be that some of the parts are on their way out, or something else? Thanks in advance."

Advice in choosing Dell laptop
"I  am in a university fellowship that is providing generous funds to buy a  laptop. I have to purchase the laptop from Dell, since the university has a  deal with them. I'm not very familiar with Dell products, so I was hoping to get some advice on which laptop to purchase. I'm thinking either 15"" XPS or 15"" Latitude. The advantage with Latitude is that it has a smart card reader (which is useful for my job), while the XPS has the option to put more >16 GB of RAM.

My work will involve the following:

\-  Scientific computing. I do a lot of programming to analyze biomedical/epidemiological datasets. The university does have a  computational cluster, but it is nice to be able to do some of that work directly  on the laptop

\- Carrying the computer between home and work

\- Smart Card Reader for remote access to network

\- Basic browsing, e-mails, reading/writing academic articles etc

\- I'd likely be dual booting Ubuntu and Windows, with Linux being my primary operating system

Any recommendation when choosing between latitude vs XPS or if you think there's another Dell laptop that you'd recommend I check out"

Dell Inspiron 7700 AIO booting into SupportAssist instead of Windows 10 with no issues ever found
"Whenever my computer starts up, it just loads SupportAssist, I'm not sure it even tries to boot into Windows first. This started when Windows decided to restart my sleeping computer (left it on during the night to farm a game) to install updates. Woke up in the middle of the night, had a moment of disorientation as I realized the screen was still on, and then started to freak out when I realized it was on some weird screen that didn't look like it was in windows. It was on the ""Hardware scan completed, no issues found"" screen, and the only option was to continue. From there Windows started up and went back to installing updates like nothing happened.  


Since then, whenever my computer turns back on it loads right into a SupportAssist hardware scan **(which at least once completed in a matter of** ***maybe*** **a couple of minutes at most, which makes me think it might not even be doing the scan right, the other times I was asleep/away from my computer for longer)** and from there whether I hit Continue or press ESC to skip the scan it loads into Windows 10. I'm not sure what is going wrong, especially since twice when it's done this when I got into Windows a few of the icons on my taskbar were replaced with the default file icon **(first time this happened it was just BlueStacks, second time it was BlueStacks and VisualBoyAdvance, both of the programs themselves seemed to be fine)** running sfc /scannow seemed to help both times. I don't know if the icons going missing is a sign of some other system corruptions or if its just random and unrelated, it's never happened to me before this.  


I haven't had any other issues, other than at one point after days of running the display started having very brief flickers to green **(which stopped once I restarted my computer, I think that was just a consequence of not turning my computer off for a while)**, also noticed odd performance hits while playing genshin that i didn't have before but there was recently an update so that could be an optimization issue recently introduced, I don't know whether it's related.  


I decided to make an account and post here because from what posts I've read of other people having this issue, Dell hasn't been super helpful when it comes to this problem. I've tried turning off Fast Boot to see if that'd stop it, it didn't. I've checked the BIOS settings to see if maybe the boot mode got changed from UEFI to Legacy, something I've read can cause this issue, but I don't think my computer's BIOS even *has* an option to change that, I looked and even though I saw references to UEFI there was no option to change that. I also checked if it was set to load the Windows Bootloader first, it was.  


Probably the first thing I should do before troubleshooting anything else is update the firmware **(Windows Update has the one for** **0.1.16.0****)** but I'm very concerned that the SupportAssist issue might mess up the firmware update and maybe brick my computer. It'd be really good if someone could tell me just how likely that is to happen and any steps I can take in the event it does screw up to be able to manually restore it, as well as any suggestions as to things that could be causing this and that I can try to do to see if one of them stops the issue. If there's any other information I should add to this post, I can do that. Thanks for reading."
KVM Switch for Dell U2722D with Optiplex 5090 and 7090
What's the best DisplayPort KVM switch for the Dell U2722D with Optiplex 5090 and 7090? Want to be able to easily switch monitors between the two desktops without having to physically move the connection. HDMI connection is fed to a WD19 for use with Latitude laptops so that port is already in use.
Dell Precision 5570 Thunderbolt ports operating in USB 3.2 Gen 1 mode???
"I recently purchased a 5570 Precision and I'm wondering if anyone else is experiencing a data transfer issue when using the TB ports with a NVME External SSD Hard Drive..

On my Desktop with a USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 port I get 1.2 Gigabytes per second.

On the Dell Precision using the USB 3.2 Gen 2x1 port on the RIGHT side I get 500 Megabytes per second.

On the Dell Precision using the TB ports on the LEFT side I get 250 Megabytes per second.

It looks like USB mode using the TB drives is only operating at USB 3.2 Gen 1 mode??

I'm using the same TB4 Type-C cable for all three tests..

You would think the TB ports would be supporting USB 3.2 Gen 2x2?"

Dell Inspiron 5680 - not booting
"Hi Everyone,

I am looking to find out where the hardware failure is on my PC.  I was playing video game with my friends, and the PC suddenly crashed.  When I hit the power button, it doesn't turn.  I researched online, and did the BIST test.  The LED is solid green, and the fans are running and the PC makes noise similar to starting up, however, the PC won't boot.  Nothing on screen.  Further research leads me to believe that I may have to replace the PSU but how can I test this?  Also, is there a way to know it's not motherboard failure?

Thank you!"
U2723QE USB-C upstream requirements
"Hello. I just purchased a U2723QE, but unfortunately a 1 meter cable isn't quite long enough to actually reach my computer for the USB upstream (so no video requirement, this computer is connected by DisplayPort), so I'm having to look for solutions for a longer cable. Right now I've got the provided USB-A to USB-C cable connected to a USB extender, which is mostly working but I've had a couple issues with the USB connection dropping (the initial setup didn't recognize my computer was connected right away, trying to install firmware resulted in it failed every time until I connected without the extender, mouse suddenly stopped working and became unrecognized by Windows, etc.). I'm not sure if that's because there's issues with the monitor, or because my setup with the extender is just too slow of a data rate , though I'm guessing the latter. So I'm curious if anyone knows if there's any sort of requirements for the upstream (like, specifically has to be USB 3 and 2.0 just flat out won't work, etc.). Thanks!"

Dell Latitude Charger issue
This port doesn't recognize my headset's mic. Can someone tell me how to fix it?
Dell Venue 5055 stuck on Windows 10 Hello screen
"Hello all, here's a quick summary of my spiraling issue(s).

1. Received a hand me down Venue 5055 device that had no sound working at all but everything else functioned / touch screen video playback etc.
   1. Resolved audio / speaker issue with installing Intel Chipset driver from Dell Support page after entering in the Service Tag to gather the appropriate driver.
   2. Tested and **worked through multiple reboots** for a little less than a month
2. Speakers stopped working, BUT headphone jack still played sound
   1. Found suggestions to reinstall Intel Chipset driver again and went back through that process
   2. Did this and no luck the second time around
   3. Found another forum mentioning a complete factory reset (in hindsight I do not recommend doing this or I would not be here now, but I did not have the foresight to know this and so am hoping for a shot in the dark here...)
3. I managed to reset Win10 on the Dell Venue 5055 tablet that is now well outside of warranty
4. It *looked* like all was going well and then it crashed to the point that it was fully resetting Win10, now no USB port connectivity in the setup nor any touch screen availability. It shows the Windows 10 Hello screen where it is asking a few questions like what country / time zone etc. Unfortunately it is not registering any touches while on this screen nor any of my USB keyboards/mice (they do not even power on the Num Lock light that pops up on other older machines of mine). Sidenote: I am able to get everything to pass (USB / touchscreen / graphics) in diagnostics though.
5. Any clue where I might get a Win10 setup that has built in drivers / allows touch screen entry or at least USB port activity, or is this Venue needing to be put out to pasture?  


If no answer for the above, I also wanted this to be a warning to not reset your Dell Venue 5055 tablet even for an inconvenient issue such as no sound without the headphone jack being used... I understand I could just go out and look for a newer one, but thought I'd ask if anyone else had bumped into this and had any ideas since this little thing is already in my possession and is mostly good just needs an OS reinstall that actually accepts touch input or allows for the USB port to function."

Dell WD19TB with desktop PC
"I've got a Dell WD19TB docking station that I use with both my personal and work laptops and it works great (one laptop is a Dell and the other a Lenovo). I'd also like to use the dock with my new desktop build, which has an ASUS ROG Strix z790-E main board and a gen 13 Intel processor. 

I can't get the video to work with the desktop, though. When I connect the dock's TB cable to the desktop's TB port (I've tried one on the back I/O panel and the one on the front of my case and gotten the same results), the keyboard, mouse, and audio (and possibly ethernet but I haven't confirmed that) work, but I get no video. 

The monitors I'm using for now are old Samsung 226BW monitors that don't even have HDMI ports and have a max resolution of 1680 x 1050 (maybe that's why I'm having the issue?) - I've got them connected to the dock via DisplayPort-to-DVI cables and that works fine with the two laptops.

Essentially, I'm trying to use the dock as a KVM switch between the 3. Maybe getting video from the desktop is impossible, but I don't know enough to know that, or if it's possible, what I can do to get it to work. I hate to invest in 2 monitors if my plan isn't going to work anyway. Any ideas or suggestions would be much appreciated!"

PowerVault MD1200 max bandwidth?
"Hi I just got a Dell PowerVault MD1200 to expand my storage. I'm somewhat new to mini SAS and how it works. I'm running 12gbps SAS drives which will be limited to 6gbps as the MD1200 is only SAS2. 

From what I've read each mini SAS cable has 4 SAS lanes so it's my understanding that a single SFF-8088 cable at SAS 2 speeds can carry 24gbps and if I ran 2 cables and used split mode for load balancing I would get 48gbps which would be 6Gbps (Gigabytes)

Am I correct or completely wrong?"

Difference in L502x motherboards
Can anyone let me know what the difference between these two motherboards for the dell 1502x are? The white socket is CN-0C47NF-48643-26L and the black one is CN-0C47NF-48643-1AA. I have searched the Internet and can't see to get a straight answer. The one on the right has an issue with powering on so bought the one on the left however it powers on with no boot and the fan on max. The one on the left has the gt525 gpu and the one on the right has the 540m. My speculation is that the one on the left was designed for the L502x with the i3 and the old one was for the i5 (the cpu have).
Battery status from 0 to 99% and back on startup
"The battery of my XPS 15 9570 goes from 99% to 0% and back when I start up my laptop.
This results in sometimes not starting up, shutting down or if I'm lucky the laptop just works.
A typical scenario is this: I start up the laptop on battery. When logged in (Windows 11), I get a warning the battery level is critically low. I plug in power and as soon it's on mains power, the battery level goes to 99%. I then disconnect the power and the laptop happily runs on battery, as expected for several hours.

Of course, I bought the device in 2019. I use it mostly plugged in. The battery might be worn.

Is this a driver issue or a battery issue?

EDIT: I'm using latest drivers via the Dell support page. Bios too is latest version."

Replacement Motherboard for XPS 7590
"Hello,

I purchased a Dell XPS 7590 1 year ago from ebay. The battery started draining slowly even though it is plugged in. I purchased a new charger, it was able to charge the laptop back to 100% for a few weeks but the battery started draining again. I bought a replacement charge port and the same thing happened, the battery was able to charge once and then started going back down even when plugged in. I then bought a replacement battery, but that didn't solve the issue either. Since I've replaced all the parts and still have the issue, I'm thinking that there is an issue with the motherboard.

&#x200B;

I called Dell's customer service. They said I could send the laptop in for them to take a look. They could confirm what part needs to be fixed and give me a quote on how much it would cost to fix it. The issue is that in order to be able to get service, I need to change the ownership of the laptop to my name. This requires information from the previous owner which I have no way of getting since I bought it from Ebay. In addition, when I try the ownership transfer form, it says my service tag is invalid. It was valid when customer support looked it up. Dell wasn't willing to help me any further. Very frustrating that I can't get service even though I'm willing to pay for it. Is there anything I can do at this point?"

WD19TB dock issues isolated to Windows 11 login screen with multiple Precision 5760 laptops
"This might be a Windows problem, but I've got a weird issue with all Precision 5760 laptops running Windows 11 in my work environment not detecting ethernet connections and USB peripherals, such and mice and keyboard, via WD19TB docks ONLY before logging into Windows from powering on the computer or waking up the computer from sleep mode. Once the computers are logged into Windows, ethernet and USB peripherals connected to the dock work fine, even after switching user accounts or signing out. Video on external monitors through the dock works fine regardless of being signed into Windows, the issue is isolated only to USB devices and ethernet. The USB devices work fine in the BIOS. This issue is not present with any other model of Dell laptop running Windows 11 paired with the WD19TB dock in my work environment. Using a generic USB-C hub with USB peripherals and ethernet connected directly to the computer appears to work fine.

The Precision 5760 laptops are running Windows 11 Enterprise, version 22H2. I have tried running all available Windows updates, ran a complete driver package reinstall and BIOS update to version 1.17.0 via Dell Command Update, updated the firmware on the WD19TB dock, uninstalled and reinstalled the Thunderbolt drivers, tried all Thunderbolt and USB-C ports on the computer, power cycled the dock, tried multiple WD19TB docks to rule out a faulty dock, verified the dock is paired with the correct 180w power supply, verified all Thunderbolt options in the BIOS are turned on, and ran hardware diagnostics which found no issues. I'm scratching my head over this. Any ideas or other troubleshooting tips to try?"

4. Disconnecting my Bluetooth headset from my PC, the following error message occurs â€œNo output devices foundâ€ -> meaning that the PC wont play ANY audio from my PC. At this moment I am able to open spotify and the video isnâ€™t buffeting anymore, but no audio is playing

5. Giving it a minute or two everything works as normal

"Upgrading a Vostro 3700, Part 2"
"Hello everyone,

I've spent the last day working on my Vostro and made some significant progress. However, I'm afraid I'm stuck again.

If you missed the previous episode: I've started to upgrade an old Dell Vostro laptop with the following specs:

Dell Vostro 3700 - Windows 7 Pro 32 bits SP1
I3 M370 2,40GHz (64 bits CPU) 
4,00 Go RAM (2,93 usable because of the 32 bits OS)
HDD 320Go

For know, I've replaced the HDD by a 320GB SSD and installed Windows 10 pro 64 bits. Yay, the main challenged is completed! Some users suggested I upgrade the RAM as well to 8GB. This is where it gets tricky... 

I got 2 sticks of 4GB DDR3 RAM at 1600MHZ. The laptop runs at 1333MHZ but 1333 MHZ sticks were out of stock or far more expensive, so I bought these ones (1600>1333 so it should run at 1333 right?). The problem is that Windows 10 does BSOD on startup with them. I tried to put back the old HDD and start: it can only use 3GB out of 8 because it has a 32 bits OS but everything runs fine at 1333MHZ. 

Do you know from where the problem might come and what I could do (driver issue? Defective stick?) 

Thanks in advance once again for your help!"

I'm very unhappy, I probably should have changed the settings from Support Assist, which however until now had never done any updates without my consent :(

DPT (Dell Pro Tip) - Converting Service Tag to Express Service Code
"I'm not sure if this is common knowledge, but the Dell Service Tag and Express Service Code are actually the exact same value, just expressed in different ways.  My best guess as to why is that the Service Tag is shorter and therefore easier to repeat and enter online, but the Express Service Code is all numbers, so is easier to enter on a phone.

The Express Service Code is obviously a base 10 number.  Less obvioiusly the Service Tag is the same number but converted to base 36 (10 digits (0 - 9) + 26 letters possible at each ""digit"").

For example, a recent post here ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dell/comments/10of075/hi_can_somebody_tell_me_the_exact_model_of_this/))  included a pic of a Vostro with a Service tag of DBH0YQ2, and an Express service code of 28991896778.  So to convert the Service tag to the Service code, you'd multiply the place value (0-9 = 0-9, A-Z = 10 - 35) by the appropriate powers of 36:

2 \* 36^(0) = 2 \* 1 = 2  
Q \* 36^(1) = (9+17)\* 36 = 936  
Y \* 36^(2) = (9 + 25) \* 1296 = 44064  
0 \* 36^(3) = 0  
H \* 36^(4) = (9  + 8)  * 1679616
= 28553472  
B \* 36^(5) = (9 + 2) \* 60466176 = 665127936  
D \* 36^(6) = (9  + 4) \* 2176782336 = 28298170368

If you add all those up, you get 28991896778, which matches the Express Service Code shown.

Obviously this isn't a particularly easy or quick conversion, and there are converters online, but I think it's helpful to know that they are are related, and by knowing one, you can figure out the other."

"Repaired Dell XPS 15 7590 still has weird smell where motherboard short took place, not sure what to do"
"Original post for context: https://www.reddit.com/r/Dell/comments/1052gsm/this_part_of_my_dell_xps_15_7590_motherboard_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

I sent my laptop to Dell with my extended warranty, and they replaced the motherboard and a few other parts. When I got it back, it booted up just fine and everything looked fine on the inside (other than a lack of thermal pads).

However, the smell I noticed when the damage first took place is back, although the system still boots and runs normally. My friend has the exact same laptop and it doesnâ€™t smell at all.

Iâ€™m not really sure what to do since they already did a repair, Iâ€™ve just kept it turned off in my closet because the smell made me cough a bit. I contacted Dell but they havenâ€™t been as helpful as before. Does anyone have any thoughts?"
Dell FX2s question.
"Hey Dell Peeps,

I am currently building a homelab with a Dell FX2s and was curious about something ESXi picked up. I have 2 separate NIC cards in rn. I have a  FN 2210S  and a 8 port ethernet passthrough. Right now the only card with any connection is the 8 port passthrough nothing is configured on the  FN 2210S. If I reading Dell's diagram [here](https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-us/poweredge-fm120/fx2ownersmanual/io-module-port-mappingfour-bay-chassis?guid=guid-a2b88bfb-faca-46d2-8e1d-c618c32cf672&lang=en-us). I should have only have 2 physical nics per node. However noticing that each node is reporting 4 physical NICs up and connected.

This leads to my 2 questions.

1.) I believe the Dell FX2s has a built in chassis switch not sure if that's what I am seeing.

2.) Is there a method of identifing what NICs are assigned to each node? I am still learning the CMC so any tips would be greatly appreciated."

Dell Precision T7500 won't work with the riser connected
"I have been fixing up a Dell Precision T7500 and have corrected all but one problem with the machine. I replaced the motherboard, CMOS battery, RAM, and the riser and processor on the riser's daughter motherboard. After replacing all of these parts, the computer boots and works well with 3x4GB sticks on the main board. Once I seat the riser with the recommended 3x4GB sticks, however, the computer turns on but shows a green ""2"" on the diagnosis indicator on the front, indicating a ""reserved"" state. I can't get it to do anything after this point and changing RAM or RAM configuration did not fix it. Any tips for moving forward?"

Dell XPS 7590 - loud fans and poor performance when using WD19TB
" I am having a problem with my XPS 7590. When I run it **plugged into a WD19TB** via TB the **fan works loudly since startup and the performance throttles**  to the point of being unable to watch a Youtube video or play games  that previously worked with no problems. 

The issue persists even after  I remove it from the docking station and usually fixes itself after  some time. Drivers  are up to date, and a fresh install did nothing to solve the issue so I  am suspecting hardware or some of the latest BIOS updates.

I also have an XPS 9500 and don't experience any of these problems when using it connected to the docking station.

Anyone run into a similar problem? It used to work fine until a few months ago."
Windows 11 install on an OptiPlex 7090 MFF
"Hi,

I'm attempting a fresh install of Windows 11 via USB key (made from MS VLC ISO). Windows setup does not find the SSD, ""No media drivers found."" I slipstreamed the 7090 drivers into the install.wim file from the 7090 deployment driver CAB with dism. That didn't work. I just placed a folder full of INF driver files on another USB key and browsed there from within the Windows installer. No dice. Setup immediately returns ""No drivers found..."" almost as if it is not even looking. The ""not found"" dialog appears immediately after selecting a target folder. I set the disk controller from RAID to AHCI in the BIOS, still no luck. Before that, I loaded factory defaults for the BIOS and then switched to AHCI. No change in setup. 

What else can I try?

Thanks"
12th gen I9 vs 12th gen I7 CPU for Dell XPS 17

Dock and display port issues
"I have an issue and would appreciate any help anybody can provide. 

I have a Dell Latitude 7400 which I connect to two monitors with a dell dock. Sorry, I don't know either of the dock names in this story - it's work gear and they don't have model names on them.

With my original dock it connected to one screen with an HDMI and the other screen with a display port cable - the kind that has a big end and a small end, with the small end being in the dock. The dock then connected to the laptop with a USB-C style cable. One day it just randomly stopped working, so I asked work for a new docking station, which they gave me.

I set up the new docking station and it works fine when connected to one screen with the HDMI but doesn't work at all when I have the display port cable in connecting to the other screen. Not sure if this matters but this dock needed a different type of display port cable, the kind with two large ends.

I have no idea why this is happening and as I'm working from home can't get my IT dept to easily look at it.

Another random bit of info in case it helps. I connected my wife's macbook to it and it displayed across all three screens, her laptop plus the two monitors. Weirdly though the monitors were an extension of her laptop screen but were a mirror of each other and her laptop only recognised it as one extra screen.

Any help appreciated!"

Dell Precision 7560 Overheating? Maybe?
"Hie there. I was an HP user but recently acquired a Dell Precision 7560, 32Gb RAM, Core i9 11th gen processor. Yet it is really really warm. 

I never had a Reddit account but this really pushed me so that I ask the community. It came with Windows 10, upgraded to Windows 11 which deleted all the drivers. Installed Support Assist which helped me download Dell Power Manager, which after installing that app, its temperature regulation was much much more improved. 

Why I said maybe in the title is because it still is really warm even with light use. I understand that it's one beast of a laptop but I had an almost comparable HP mobile workstation (Z-book), but it didn't get this warm. 

Someone said it's because of the metal chassis which is plausible. So I was starting to think that maybe that's how it is with Dell Precision laptops.

Then this afternoon, left the laptop plugged into power, it went to sleep. When I came back, it was cooking. I mean I could literally crack an egg on it and watch it cook faster than the highest temperature on my stove. Dell users, please help me. 

1. Is the Dell Precision 7560 normally warm even with light use?
2. How do I solve the overheating issue on sleep mode"
Problems with old Dell switch
"I'm still new to this so apologies if I miss any important details.

We have an old Dell N3024 switch that has been working great until this morning. This morning at around 6am, it seems like half of the ports on the switch just died. Whenever I plug my laptop in to one of the dead ones, the green lights come on and start flashing and I get an IP address, but no connection. I can't ping anywhere inside or outside the network. This seems to have affected about half of the ports seemingly at random. Like I said, I'm still fairly new to this and I'm not even sure where to begin troubleshooting at this point. Any help would be appreciated."
Keyboard missing letters
"Hi, I have a Dell Inspiron 5593 and since september the in-build keyboard randomly skip letters.

Randomly means that sometimes skip a-s-d-l-enter, sometimes also j-k-7-9 in the numeric keypad.

First time it showed this problem was in september, randomly skipping some letters.

I update from windows 10 to windows 11 but nothing changed. I also restored the computer to fabric setting, same result. 

At the beginning the PC was still usable, because after few minutes insisting, the letters started to work again.

Then the university re-started, and I used the pc every day, at least 5 hours/day, and for 4 month the problem seems to be solved by itself and everything was fine. 

For a couple of weeks I used an external ergonomic keyboard to play a MMORPG, then when i returned to the in-build keyboard the problem was back. 

I used it for another month with almost no iussues (sometimes some letters were missing ( not normal but acceptable) and in the last week it became impossible to use the keyboard: a-s-d-f-j-k-l-Ã²-7-9-enter are not working, only with a high pressure on the right key the letters start working for a couple of second, then dies again.

There is no dirt under the keyboard, and anyway i gently cleaned it with dry compressed air. It never get wet and no liquid was ever spilled on it.

**The following things doesn't seems to affect the functionality/disfunctionality**: battery charge, with or without current connection, operating system, driver, program used, temperature.

**Things that have some relation with the problem**: the more frequent i use the computer, the less the problem appears. The first time I've seen this was after a couple of month almost not using it at all.

when using it everyday for many hours a day worked fine, now that i skip some days and use it for few hours, some letters are completely dead.

When letters are stuck, unlocking one of them allows the others to work for few seconds, in kept in use.

Changing the keyboard will cost 1/4 of the entire computer value, so if there is something else I can try, please tell me!

2015 Dell XPS carbon deck still in virtually-new condition
"I am pleasantly surprised to note that the carbon deck on my 7-year-old XPS laptop still is in virtually-new condition.

Visually, the carbon fibre and the soft rubbery coating look new. No mars, scratches, or chips. In 2015, we feared that the soft rubbery coating would become sticky and show wear marks. 

Gently cleaning with a microfibre cloth (type used for eyeglasses) dampened slightly with just water is easy and the only effective way I found to remove oil and grime from the carbon fibre.

This is a 2015 Dell XPS 9550 (15""). This laptop gets a lot of use every day but rarely leaves the desk."
Dell XPS 13 Reviews?
"I was looking to buy a new laptop and right now I'm really interested with the Dell XPS 13 with i5 - 1250U. I was originally going to get one with a P-series processor but all I've been hearing about those is that they're prone to overheating and the battery life was not very good. I was wondering if anyone who has or is using this laptop could tell me a bit about their experience.

My main concern is battery life and fan noise?I am a programming student but I usually like to do heavy work on my pc at home but sometimes working on my laptop is inevitable, usually in a classroom or library setting. The most intensive thing I'll probably do is be on a zoom call with a few chrome tabs open or running Docker. I feel like that isn't intense at all so I'd really like for the fans stay quiet.In terms of battery life would 6 hours while doing those tasks and 8-10hours while browsing be a fair ask?

Replace CPU on Dell E6430
"My old Dell E6430 died so I bought a refurbished one off ebay until I can purchase a better one. 
The ebay one comes with a i3-3110 processor, while my old motherboard had a i7-3520 (If I'm not wrong, the marking on the CPU is not useful).
I believe I could swap the CPUs to reuse the more powerful i7, but the heatsink and cooling system is different between the two laptops (probably another motherboard version). 
The fan is not swappable, the screws are offset by a few mm. 
So do you think I can swap the CPU but keep the fan form the ebay laptop? It has only one 'duct', so maybe less heat sink capabilities? Is there a risk in swapping the CPU in your opinion? 
Thanks!"

"How to power 1x 3.5"" HDD and 1x 2.5"" SSD in Optiplex 7050 SFF?"
"Or even for that matter, how would one do this with 2x 2.5"" SSDs (which it seems more explicitly designed for)?

I'm totally new to dealing with computer internals aside from some simple 2.5"" drive and RAM swaps in laptops, so sorry for the newbie questions. I'm super excited for the ride though.

I just received an Optiplex 7050 SFF that has the caddy which holds 2x 2.5"" drives in place of the 3.5"" caddy. It arrived with a 2.5"" SSD already plugged in with one SATA cable and one power cable. I only see one other available SATA cable and one available power cable, however it only has two leads. I assume these two cables are for the optical drive (which I don't have).

I did purchase the tray that holds a 2.5"" drive where the optical drive goes. I'm wondering:
- How would I go about powering a second 2.5"" SSD?
- And could I instead power 1x 2.5"" SSD and 1x 3.5"" HDD?
- What about 3x 2.5"" SSDs?

Looks like the power supply is rated for 180W. I assume this is no problem, but again just want to be sure since I'm totally new.

Any help is greatly appreciated! TIA!"

I dealt with it for months, even editing the power plan and turning off boost yet it did nothing. then I downloaded speedfan and I constantly run my fan on full power. it still throttles sometimes and it runs MUCH slower then it should be. and it still is ALWAYS at 95+C, IT INSTANTLY THROTTLES AFTER TURNING ON EVEN AFTER NO USE FOR A WHILE!! I opened it up to see if the fan was dirty and it was clean. I finally replaced the thermal paste still and its the same as before. if I didn't have speedfan constantly running it would throttle every 10 seconds. I am so tired of this bs, ik its not storage or any applications or anything else, Its so stupid how this laptop can run fine and good for months then just one day start getting insanely hot under little load. I am so fed up I really need a fix. also when it was working fine I even layed it on my stomach and it ran fine, if I tried that today it would constantly throttle even with speedfan running 24/7. all the online ""fixes"" are the same bs that I already tried. and i replaced the thermal paste yesterday fyi and the fan was still clean!"

The output device was the standard windows speaker,  but there didn't appear to be an internal mic for me to use. When i hooked up my headphones that had a microphone, my laptop still wasn't registering there was a microphone to use.

What does this mean and how can I fix this? 

Thank you!"
Powersave Hell. (No signal issue)
"I've never posted here before but I hope you can help. 

For the last 3 days, my desktop monitor has been going to sleep. Whenever I turn it on, it instantly goes into power save mode. It says it's an issue with having no signal, I already unplugged all the cables and replugged them. Turning the tower and monitor off and restarting them. I'm honestly lost. Any suggestions...?"

Dell XPS 17 (gaming) peformance
"While I know the XPS line isn't made for gaming, and I'm not buying one *exclusively* to game (probably using it more as a desktop replacement, so streaming videos, web browsing, but also some 3D modelling and rendering), I'm curious how the XPS 17 performs, especially in more AAA games like Cyberpunk 2077. I'm thinking of purchasing the 9720 model with the RTX 3060, 12th gen I7, and 32 GB of ram."

XPS 7590 wakes from sleep with 1% battery remaining but this is an incorrect charge level
"Hi everyone. I have an XPS 7590, which has worked pretty well for me since I got it new in 2019. I'm aware of the Windows sleep issue so usually I would put my laptop into hibernate mode instead of using the sleep mode since the sleep mode would often lead to the laptop battery dying while not in use.

However, I recently noticed that Windows sleep seems somewhat more usable if I put my laptop to sleep while it is not plugged in. If I put the laptop to sleep while it is plugged in and then unplug it after, that results in the battery dying while I'm not using the laptop. But if I put the laptop to sleep after unplugging it, it seems more often to sleep correctly.

An issue I've noticed though is that when I wake the laptop from sleep, it seems to be reporting an incorrect battery charge level. An example of what is happening is, I'll put my  laptop to sleep while unplugged after finishing with it at night with around 49% battery charge remaining. The next morning, I turn it on/wake it from sleep and it says to plug in immediately as there is only 1% charge remaining. When I do plug it in though, the battery charge suddenly reports that I have 47% battery charge remaining.

This issue has happened to me a few times now and the battery charge level usually seems to reset/be corrected by plugging in the laptop, allowing me to use it for another couple hours on battery. Does anyone have an idea of what is happening or how to resolve this issue of incorrectly reporting the battery charge upon waking from sleep? I haven't figured out a way to get the battery to report the correct charge level without briefly plugging the charger in first."

Dell requested a full screen photo for a dead pixel warranty. Should I comply?
"So my UP3216Q monitor happened to have 3 groups of about 10 dead (black) subpixels in total. I took close-up photos on each of them and sent to Dell tech support. These close-up photos showed the dead pixels clearly.

It all went well until Dell requested a ""Full Screen"" photo. Because my screen is 32 inches in size, my camera wonâ€™t possibly have the optical resolution to show dead pixels in a full screen scale. I explained to them but they insisted this is ""policy"". 

I was wondering if it is OK to just send a full screen photo to Dell that has doesn't show dead pixels properly? Will it be used as evidence against me just because of the physical limitation of my camera? I appreciate any advice you have."

Trackpad issue XPS 15 9500
"Trackpad Not Clicking

I have a Dell XPS 15 9500. Recently I spilled something on it and it seeped into the trackpad. I opened it up asap, cleaned it and dried it thoroughly. Now the mousepad works, but, it will not click. This is an issue and I was wondering if anyone had a fix. 

I tried reinstalling drivers and everything and nothing has worked. What to do? Also the battery does not look swollen so I don't think that's the issue. Thank you"
G16 7620 Power adapter or Docking station
"I have been wanting to get a second power option for home use and keep my original charger in my travel bag but I can't seem to find a replacement on Dell support site.  If possible, I would really like to get a docking station but I am unsure if my G16 7620 could even support a docking station.  Brand new with a 3060 and USB-C options in the rear.  Also, I am weary of a docking station because I can't really find any on there site that provides the same power as the factory adapter (240W).  

What are me options for this?"
Problems running single channel RAM in XPS 15 9570.
"I upgraded to 32GB RAM last month (16x2) but there seems to be a problem with one of the sticks, so I plan on sending it back to Crucial and running single channel 16GB for now (left behind my 8x2 sticks - big mistake). 

But when I start it up, my laptop doesn't seem to support single channel RAM? It's very slow and I get a warning that there's not enough RAM (can't remember exactly). 

Is there an option in the BIOS or something that I need to enable before trying to run single channel memory, or maybe this indicates a problem with both memory sticks? (Hope not...)

ETA: I am on Windows 11 btw."

unable to install fresh windows on laptop
"I have a dell laptop that is loaded with dells bloatware.

I am trying to do a fresh windows 10 install from a bootable usb.

I tried changing the settings in bios to legacy and tried UEFI as well.

when restarting the laptop with the win10 usb plugged in, the windows logo shows for a few seconds then goes away. It comes back for a few more seconds then the laptop restarts.

What is the problem?

Is the BIOs out of date?

The USB works because i have used it to install windows on two other machines already. I am so sick of dell, worst purchase i ever made.

Dell Command Update (Locksettings)
"Has anyone noticed that if you launch DCU as a normal (non-admin) user that you cannot alter the settings?   As in, all the options can be read but not altered ""Greyed out"".

I'm asking for my sanity because I swear we were able to do this, but in our management script we enable the option below:

 dcu-cli.exe /configure -lockSettings=enable 

Dell's description of the feature:  ""Allows the user to lock all the settings in the UI. ""

When I try to disable this feature, e.g. ""-Locksettings disable"" it alters registry and confirms success but nothing changes.

Lastly however, if I run DCU (the GUI) as admin, I can alter the options.  Is this a bug, or intentional?"

Water damage
"I spilled some matcha on my bed the other day and it was near my closed laptop but not on it and I checked and it was dry. Thatâ€™s the setting lol. But now after a day Iâ€™m noticing my track pad sorta lags or if I leave in still while Iâ€™m reading something online it â€˜right clicksâ€™ itself which would be a two finger tap on the pad. And sometimes even click an option. Maybe I did get it wet without noticing some how? Itâ€™s all I can think of. This laptop is not only brand new 2 months old but itâ€™s my first one ever. I really baby it. This hiccup makes me so sad. 

My question is does Dell have an internal check for water damage how an Apple IPhone does? My schedule hardly allows me to take it in a store which I bought from Best Buy online. Are they very helpful if my issues continues?"

Dell U3223QE USB-PD Interference with Audio Out jack
"I just got a brand new Dell  U3223QE 32"" 4K Monitor delivered today. 

I have my Dell XPS 15 laptop connected using the USB-C cable that came with the monitor to the USB-PD port. I keep getting a low level of static interference from the speakers I have connected to the Audio Out jack on the monitor. Audio plays fine except for the constant low level of static interference which is there even if the system is not making a sound.

Here are all the other things I've tried to do isolate the problem:

1. Tried different USB-C cables between my monitor and my laptop to see if the cable was the problem. Still get static.
2. Tried hooking up different laptops, including a Mac and another XPS, to the monitor USB-C PD port to see if the laptop was the problem. Still get static.
3. Unplugged all other USB peripherals from the monitor. Still get static.
4. Tried different audio AUX cables between the monitor and my speaker setup. Still get static.
5. Connected my laptop to the display using HDMI instead of USB-C PD. Static goes away but now I cannot charge my laptop.
6. Leave the laptop connected to the display using the USB-C PD port but connect the speakers to Audio Out jack on the laptop. Static goes away but now I have to deal with the clutter of the audio cable and unplug it while switching laptops. 

So all this makes me wonder if I got a bad, poorly shielded unit somehow or if there is a design flaw in the monitor that makes the USB-PD interfere with the Audio jack right next to it. 

If it helps, my XPS 15 laptop normally comes with a 130W power adapter, so the laptop is maxing out the USB-C port's 90W PD.

Anyone else have an Dell UltraSharp monitor with similar problems, even if in a different size?"
Dell 8930 reboots when starting (some) games
"I'm experiencing a recent problem... When starting games, the computer will often shut down and reboot.  It's not likely a heating issue - when I say ""when starting games,"" I mean it.  The reboots often take place before the main menu for the game is displayed - long before the CPU has time to overheat.

There's no consistency to the games affected.  Some games - it happens a lot.  Others, rarely or never.

About a year ago, the PSU on my computer died, and I got it replaced locally.  However, the problem I'm seeing started about a month ago - I've added no new hardware since then.  Again - I've been using my third-party PSU for at least nine months with no issues.  These problems started in the last month.

A few days ago, I used Handbrake to convert about 150 hours of video; a process that took about 24 nonstop hours.  I used the Nvidia NVENC feature to speed things up.  During this ""stress test,"" there were no reboots at all.  Today, I loaded the ""Anger Foot"" demo\* on Steam, and the system rebooted the moment the main menu appeared.  After the reboot, I tried again.  I completed one level of the game - and then it rebooted.  Yesterday, I played an hour or more of ""Deep Rock Galactic"" with no problems at all.  I do not recall ever encountering a reboot OTHER than when playing a game.

If anyone has any ideas, or if more info is needed from my end, please share.

I've already tried:

* Reviewing the Event Viewer, which shows nothing more than ""The system shut down unexpectedly.""
* Updating all drivers, including the BIOS
* Ran the full diagnostics on the Dell Support site, no issues found

Basic specs:

Dell 8930, 32GB RAM, nVidia GeForce GTX 1080, Windows 10

Monitor Frozen ?
"I called Dell support and they told me that my tech support expired ? I had to pay extra for it?
Anyways, never buying a Dell monitor again. I have never heard of another company doing this.

But alas for the issue.

I have a Dell 2721QS connected to a  2021 MacBook pro 14 via a display port cable, caldigit ts3 and a caldigit thunderbolt 4 cable. 

I have been dealing with the intermittent but inevitable screen flicker- which I have been unable to find a non-random fix for.

The problem: my screen is stick displaying a faded , flickering image of the last thing shown before I reset the MacBook. Now it's even displaying that when not connected to the MacBook . When it is connected it is still there but the actually display is super imposed overtop of this ""faded ghost image"".

I have no idea what to google to try to trouble shoot this. Please help.

I have tried: factory resetting monitor and removing and reconnecting power supply."

Issues with Latitude E5470 charging. Should I replace my laptop?
"I've had a latitude e5470 for 8 years now, I have replaced the battery a few times over its life. Two years ago, I had to replace the charger because it got damaged. I bought the new one from Dells website and made sure my laptop was listed in compatible devices.

Recently my laptop is having troubles charging. When its plugged in and I'm using it, it connects and disconnects without the actual charger moving. If I turn it off and leave it to charge, it does so EXTREMELY slowly. Example, it had 25% battery so I turned it off and left it plugged in for 10 hours, it is now at 51%. 

I replaced the battery since it was 2ish years old at this point. But no change. Now I'm wondering if I should try to replace the charger but my model is no longer listed as compatible with any chargers on Dells website.

Should I just replace my laptop? Do you know of somewhere else I can get a reliable charger?"
Docking Station for Inspiron 14 5425?
"Hi - I am moving from a Latitude 7400 2-in-1 to a Inspiron 14 5425.  With my old laptop (the Latitude), I had Belkin docking station for my two monitors and wireless keyboard.  The Belkin uses a USB-C to connect to my Latitude, but, even though my Inspiron has a USB-C port, it's not working with the monitors or keyboard.  What docking station do I need to buy for my Inspiron to make it compatible with my 2 monitors and wireless keyboard?"

Ready to re-connect HDD
"I added an SSD to my Vostro 3470 SFF today, and everything went well. I did a clean install of Windows 10 and it runs great. I disconnected my HDD upon the advice of many from previous posts after I uninstalled all of the applications except the Windows and Dell stuff. I have a ton of media files that I want to keep on the HHD. I have installed all of my apps onto the SSD and now I am ready to reconnect the HDD. Is there anything I should be worried about? Will it figure out that it is not the C drive anymore or do I need to do something in the BIOS or in windows? All of the media files are also backed up both in the cloud and on an external drive, but I would really like them to stay on the internal HDD as well if possible. Also, should I be worried about the old Windows and Dell update stuff that is still on the HDD? Thanks for your help everyone!!"

Intel Management Engine Interface BIOS Extension (MEBx) Option suddenly disappeared on Dell Optiplex 7010 MT BIOS
"Hello there,

So I have this old and used Dell Optiplex 7010 MT that I have been using for 3 years, and it's hardware have been behaving really weird in the past 2 months, the on-board controller sometimes stops working and I have to disable then re-enable it again to work, and the Intel Management Engine Interface BIOS Extension (MEBx) thing that was available when I bought this PC is now no longer available in the F12 one time boot menu.

**Is there any way I can fix this?, I have tried all of the following:**

1. Reinstalling Windows Intel ME Drivers.
2. Downgrading BIOS from A29 to A26 and the reversed the process too (Upgraded from A26 to A29)
3. Installing the Service Mode Jumper.
4. Changing boot mode from UEFI to Legacy and from Legacy to UEFI too.
5. Turning on the computer without hard drive to see if it's the cause of this issue.
6. Resetting CMOS settings via removing and reseating the CMOS battery and using the RTCRST jumper on the motherboard.
7. Disassembling the entire PC (part by part) then reassembling it again (Basically tried reseating everything on the motherboard)
8. Cleaning the PC.
9. Removing individual components and attempting to power on without them (to see if a specific component might be the cause of this issue or not)
10. Reinstalling Windows OS.
11. Installing Linux.

Alienware M17 Screen problem
"Hi everyone, 

I have an Alienware M17 i7 16GB 2070 RTX that I bought in 2019. I use it once in a while to play games and i have a separate XPS13 for work and everything else. my warranty is ended in 2020, and a couple months ago my screen started flickering and there are vertical lines and the screen becomes really dark. I tried everything, reinstalled the graphics card, did diagnostics nothing works. when i connected it to an external monitor the problem persisted on my laptop but the external monitor is fine. 

I put my service tag and I saw i can still extend my warranty, they have the monthly subscription, with the reinstatement fee the total for support plus is $84 . I called the warranty people and he offered me to pay 499 to extend the warranty until the end of the support period for my laptop in July 2024. But i don't want to spend that much money on 3+ yo laptop. I bought it brand new for $2,500 back then. Do you think if I do the monthly subscription for a month they would replace/fix my LCD? any suggestions or feedback would be appreciated. 

Best,

Replacing Fan XPS7390 (2 in 1)
"Hi, 

I broke my video fan while cleaning. Specifically, the blades of the fan are broken off. I sent it to Dell for replacement and their diagnosis service is estimating $300+ because they also want to replace the motherboard. 

They did not provide an explanation as to why- why would my motherboard need replacing if I only broke my video fan blades?

My 2019 Alienware M15 is an excellent system
"Just wanted to say that my M15 has been great for the 4 years I've had it now. I made use of the service contract twice, once to send it in for a dead audio chip, and a second time to have a technician out to replace the battery which was swelling. Haven't needed any work on it in the last 2 years. That service contract is ending this March, so I had thought about getting it extended.

Turns out a single year extension with a ""discount"" for calling before my existing contract expired was going to run me US$391... I'm like if the contract had a guarantee of replacement parts, then I'd have just demanded a new battery during the year at a MINIMUM. But for $391, I can just happily order a replacement battery or whatever other parts I think I might need and swap them myself. For just the insurance of MAYBE replacing something that would be reasonable to be in the $99 range, not quadruple that.

That said, I've really enjoyed the M15 and it's still a highly capable machine that I will probably hang onto and game with for another 5 years minimum."

(Windows 11) Integrated webcam on Dell XPS 9300 turns off/crashes repeatedly and randomly disappears from Device Manager for random periods of time.
"I have an integrated camera on a Dell XPS 9300 that will function fine for some given period of time and then without any (obvious) reason, repeatedly turn on and off and then eventually just disappear entirely. 

It will do this regardless of the software - Zoom, Google Meet, Camera, Windows 11 Settings. 

This was happening on Windows 10 and I updated to Windows 11 to try and fix this, error has not gone away. 

Heres a short clip of the issue happening - https://gfycat.com/defensiveamusingicelandichorse 

Things Iv tried: 

- Updating windows
- Checking privacy settings
- Removing, reinstalling drivers
- Unchecking the `Allow this computer to turn off this device to save power` option in every USB device in Device Manager
- Disabling the `Windows Hello` software device
- Adding `EnableFrameServerMode` entries to the registry
- Checking the camera is enabled in the BIOS
- Closing any software, background processes that could even remotely be interfering with the webcam
- Disabling firewalls, antivirus software
- Looking for errors in Event Viewer - nothing at all related shows up. 

Iv heard Realtek can cause issues but I don't seem to have a `RsProviders` directory, so I don't think this is it.

"I boggles my mind that a brand like Dell can't get the fan regulation right. It's been a constant problem since I got my laptop last year. I have read every thread on it, tried everything. I can't even regulate the fan through third party software like 'speedfan' since the motherboard doesn't support it. 

This is just a rant and I know at this point no one has a solution for this. I am considering buying an Asus Vivobook to replace this piece of sh\*t machine since they at least have more options in UEFI and better power management tools.

Is this a good idea?

Microsoft Power Automate Safe? Third Party Google Chrome Extension? Help
"I was using Microsoft Edge (\~1,173 MB in Task manager), then I decided to download Google Chrome (\~553 MB in Task manager) â€“ however, there was an â€œerrorâ€ message once I signed into Chrome next to the user logo icon and three button menu dot top right corner. I click it and it stated something (I forgot) but it took me to a Chrome Extension, and it was Microsoft Power Automate â€“ I did not install this obviously, then the review referenced key logging and sending data to third party services and not being affiliated with Microsoft. However, when I access my Extensions, it does not list it as installed, so was this a glitch or:

Is there a way to have a hidden extension installed?

Is this possibly an extension installed under my Google Chrome profile and Windows caught the app and removed it?

R740 fiber connection with quantum tape library dead but loopback test appears to pass.
" I'll do my best to provide all the details I can but ask away..

I have an R740 Dell PowerEdge server with dual port 10GB Broadcom NetExtreme SFP+ Ethernet network daughter card where I've plugged in a SFP+ single mode fiber 10GB LR transceiver, brand name 10gtek part# â€ŽAXS13-192-10-Cisco2. I have connected a single mode fiber optic cable there and the other end on a quantum scalar library tape drive 8GB fibre channel connection(no transceiver needed there) but i see no link light status on R740's NIC. I performed a loopback test on the dual R740 SFP+ ports by connecting them to each other with same type transceivers of course and got green link lights. I'm not sure what to make of all this or where the incompatibility lies between all new equipment and accessories. The OS is Windows Svr 2019 and has all and the latest drivers. I'm certain the system doesn't have a fiber channel HBA as it utilizing the NDC card described. One of the SFP+ NIC port on the same card has an cat 7 ethernet cable connected also by transceiver and has no issues, status lights are green. I've tried swapping the ports I'm connecting the fiber but no luck. I'm very new with this type of networking and hoping someone more experienced can point out the obvious. Dell support says their hardware has no issues based on logs.

I see someone here with a similar issue but their solution hasn't worked for me. [https://www.dell.com/community/PowerEdge-Hardware-General/R740-Fiber-Module-issue/td-p/6089505](https://www.dell.com/community/PowerEdge-Hardware-General/R740-Fiber-Module-issue/td-p/6089505)"

New (refurb) R430 won't POST when I add more than 1 drive to it
"I bought an R430 from eBay from a seller who sells/refurbs all kinds of servers it seems. I put an SSD in one of the four 3.5"" slots and installed ESXi on it and had it running for a day or so while testing things out. Today I racked it and put my other drives in it, 3x 12 TB HDDs.  When that happens, I get the icon for ""electrical issue"" and the ""health issue"" both blinking. It will not POST.  If I try and just run it with the SSD inside, it will POST and work fine pretty consistently.  If I try it with just 3x HDD's inside of it, it will not POST.

Both PSUs, 550W Platinums, show green lights throughout this. I have tried just using either one with different cords and power inputs (surge protector, UPS, wall).  I have tried reseating the PSUs.  To me it sounds like something PSU related, but it's odd it only happens when the HDDs are plugged in. I also tried a variety of HDDs too like just booting up with the SSD and the HDD.

I read in the manual the having a mix of SSDs and HDDs isn't supported, but I can't imagine this is the issue. Besides, just booting with HDD's won't POST either.  For reference, when it will not POST, the fans spin down, there is no networking, no VGA out (either front or back VFA), and the error lights just blink.  Any ideas?

 EDIT: Probably should have looked at iDRAC logs first. Tons of CPU voltage issues... Sounds like bad CPU or board maybe?

Latitude 7370 TPM issue
"I have a Latitude 7370 that I got from my work's decommission pile. It's been a great machine but recently the ""TPM not detected"" message has been happening on every boot. I've tried every fix and workaround from Dell and other support forums and I've come to the conclusion that the TPM is just dead from likely hardware failure. This machine also does not think it has Bluetooth either despite having an Intel wireless card that definitely has Bluetooth so I'm guessing this thing's just a little bit of a lemon. But it's almost 6 years old, fully out of warranty, and I'm not willing to replace the motherboard to fix the TPM problem on a laptop I got for free and otherwise works fine.

However, I was wondering if anyone knew of a way to get it to not care that the TPM isn't detected and prompt me on every single boot to press a button about it. I don't care if the TPM works or not and I don't need the functionality it provides so I don't want to see the complaint during every boot. Is there a way to get it to think it doesn't have a TPM or to otherwise ignore the problem during boot and not prompt me anymore?"

Dell Rugged 5430 Aftermarket WWAN
"I have a Dell Rugged 5430 that I ordered without GPS. I recently upgraded the ram and in the process discovered that all of the required cables are present to install a WWAN chip. 

Correct me if I'm wrong, but GPS is part of the WWAN chip, right?  If I installed a WWAN chip, the GPS should function, correct?

My question stems around the possibility of adding an aftermarket chip. It looks like the 5430 uses either  a DW5821e or DW5560 chips. I was looking at those chips and can get them for $90. What I'm curious about is if the machines ship with an existing antenna?  I read that some people have said previous iterations ship without the antennas.

Help with a Dell WD22TB4 Dock
"ðŸ‘‹ Hello.

&#x200B;

I was wondering if anyone could share some light on an issue I have.

I have a Dell XPS 15 9510 Laptop, of which I wanted to start using more and get away from my personal desktop for work. I decided to invest in a docking station, of which needed to be able to push 3x 4K @ 60Hz screens. 

I have a setup which is still half installed from my last job where I used 2x Dell D6000 Docks Via. USB 3 to push these displays and had 2 USB-C's connected to my work laptop. (One of the Dell D6000 Docks was works, one was mine, so I only have one now).

&#x200B;

I looked into different docks Dell supplied and came across the Dell WD22TB4, which should be able to run 3x 4K @ 60Hz through a single Thunderbolt connection.

&#x200B;

However, when setup the first time I ran into the following issue.

With ALL displays connected to the dock at the same time.

Having 1 active at a time, allowed Windows to push 4k @ 60 Hz.

Having 2 active at the same time, allowed Windows to push 1 at 4K @ 60Hz and 1 at 4k @ 30Hz.

Having 3 active at the same time, allowed Windows to push all 3 at 4K @ 30Hz.

&#x200B;

This is less than ideal, to confirm - rotating through the Windows settings, I could push each display individually at 4K @ 60Hz. Which means that it's not the cabling to the displays nor the displays at fault.

&#x200B;

I've since installed;

Latest Laptop BIOS.

Latest Dock Firmware.

Upgraded Nvidia Drivers.

Upgraded Intel Drivers.

Uninstalled and Reinstalled (from Dell website) Thunderbolt software/driver.

&#x200B;

Now, I've restarted my laptop and I'm stuck with the following.

3x Displays all active. 1x 4K @ 60Hz, 2x 1440 @ 59.95Hz. I cannot for the life of me change to 60 Hz on these displays, Windows give me no option to. Intel Graphics Comamnd Center allows me to select it, but it makes no change.

Again, disabling one display at 1440 allows me to now have 2x 4K @ 60Hz, so we're on a slight improvement. But a third, means the above. 2x 1440P.

&#x200B;

Any suggestions on how I can get all 3 displays connected at 60Hz? 30Hz is just painful to use.

&#x200B;

I have recently ordered this: [https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B075V5JK36](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B075V5JK36)

Awaiting delivery tomorrow, to try in Port 5. ([https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0653/8569/3424/products/61izRE8-Z0L.\_AC\_SL1378.jpg?v=1660296653](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0653/8569/3424/products/61izRE8-Z0L._AC_SL1378.jpg?v=1660296653))

&#x200B;

Current monitor setup is.

Two are in Ports 3, One is in Port 4.

Port 3 = DisplayPort to HDMI Adapter, to HDMI in the Monitor.

Port 4 = HDMI straight to monitor.

Any ideas?

XPS15 now or later?
"So I'm looking at upgrading my M1 MacBook Pro to an XPS15. The reason I'm upgrading is because in the degree I'm going into (STEM), MacBooks simply can't run most of the software, not to mention it's only got 8GB RAM.

I can get the XPS15 with the i7, 32GB RAM, 3050ti, 512GB storage, and the OLED for about $3300AUD (probably around $2200USD) on clearance.

However, the model with the 13th gen CPU is likely less than 6 months away now and could potentially solve many of the battery/heat management problems that I've read that the current model has.

I know no one can know for sure what a 13th gen XPS would look like, but are the new chips significantly better than current gen? I would imagine an updated XPS could cost close to double to what this current one is sitting at."

I have an old GX520 small form factor PC I wanted to start using, but I'm having some issues with it.  It's an XP system but I added more memory and put in a new hard drive so I could install Windows 7 on it.  I bought it used and it came with 2x 1Gb memory sticks.  it only has 2 memory slots on the board, so I replaced the 1Gb sticks w 2x 2Gb sticks but the system will not boot Windows 7 with both sticks inserted.  it freezes on the Windows logo screen. the BIOS detects both properly when they are inserted at the same time.  it will boot into Win7 with either of the sticks when I only have 1 inserted, and WinXP will boot properly when both are installed so to me they both work fine.  

The system is running A05 BIOS. there is an A10 version on the Dell support site that mentions an issue w the memory. I do not know if its this particular issue but I was hoping an updated BIOS might resolve this problem.  I have tried to install the BIOS update in fresh installs of both WinXP and in Win7 as well as using a bootable FreeDOS USB stick, but I keep getting the error message shown in the screenshot.  I have verified all 3 checksum values (MD5,SHA1, and SHA256) listed on the download page and even tried downloading the file from 2 separate PCs but nothing is working.  there is also an A11 BIOS file that is dated back in 2001 (A10 is dated 2020)  but I get an error when running that BIOS update file also.  similar but different error message tho.  I have also tried running the file as administrator even thought I'm logged in as administrator and also tried running in compatibility mode, but still get the same error.

the only solutions I have found for BIOS update failures online say to remove all extra USB devices other than mouse and keyboard but those are the only devices I have connected, or go into msconfig and click the hide all MS services, uncheck any remaining services and then reboot and try again but when I check to hide all MS services there's nothing left that I can uncheck since its a fresh install of Windows.

anybody have any suggestions as to what I can do to get this BIOS updated."

G5 5590 not booting
"My wife's Dell G5 5590 is not booting up. When pressing the power button, the power button will flash for as long as it is held down. After releasing the power button, the charging LED on the left side will flash white once.

There is no indication of power on the laptop and there are no amber flashes to indicate a troubleshooting code.

I've replaced the charging plug with no improvement in symptom. 2 different charging cords show the same symptom. I've also followed the standard troubleshooting process of disconnecting the battery and holding down the power button for 30 seconds to discharge any residual power.

I'm starting to think the motherboard may be cooked but wanted to see if anyone else has seen or fixed this issue.

Outrageous support for a brand new AW3432DWF
"I figured I would post this here.

I ordered an AW3432DWF a couple weeks ago, and it's been amazing in every aspect so far except one issue I'm having : the monitor makes cracking/popping plastic sounds when I start using it, occasionally during usage, and especially **after** using it (which is probably due to the plastic expanding and going back into place due to the heat).

I could live with it if it didn't happen **1h** to **1h30 after I turn if off**.

My desk is in my bedroom, so when I'm trying to sleep  the monitor makes those very loud noises.

I also noticed I'm not the only one experiencing this, as I found another case on Reddit :  [Popping/cracking sound coming from AW3423DW then cooling/heating : ultrawidemasterrace (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ultrawidemasterrace/comments/vci0vw/poppingcracking_sound_coming_from_aw3423dw_then/) 

But it gets better.

Soon after realizing, I got in touch with the tech support. They asked a ton of useless information about my computer even though I clearly specified the issue was hardware-related and had nothing to do with my system. After giving all that info anyway, I was asked to send a pic of a sheet of paper with my name, the date, time and my location next to the S/N and support number of the monitor, which I did too.

I was told that, since the monitor was less than 2 weeks old (so still within the return time frame), I would get a brand new unit.

Imagine my surprise when UPS delivered today a package that was made of regular cardboard.

After opening it, it didn't take long for me to realize that I had been sent a ""refurbished"" unit, even though I have proof that the support told me (twice !) I'd get a **new one :**

[Proof I was to get a new unit](https://preview.redd.it/sxuzc1cvylga1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0357d1326e7b60f526582049d489e6c69190afea)

But it's just getting started.

I took out the box that contains the stand, and noticed there was some kind of greasy liquid on it, with multiple fingerprints on the other side which was not even cleaned :

[Greasy liquid on the stand](https://preview.redd.it/zagff02zylga1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c53f9e07874cf7b12740df6554941eacbc5ab9e1)

But that's nothing compared to what's next (at least, I could've reused the stand of my current one).

I took the panel out of the box as well, and immediately noticed some cleaning fluid was used of the gloss panel, even though it said in the user manual **NOT TO USE ANYTHING ELSE** than the provided cloth.

I exposed the panel to light, and ... thought it was some sort of joke.

It is literally covered with scratches, from top to bottom.

So Dell basically expects me to replace my shiny, brand new monitor with a disgusting, scratched unit in very poor condition.

[Scratches under light](https://preview.redd.it/l2m90to2zlga1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e806abd16e5cf6d2c51cebbfe52a7edd82aa3590)

[Some more scratches](https://preview.redd.it/h401sjp3zlga1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8e96ee4afb74410d98e3610231a2183f377956f5)

[From up close](https://preview.redd.it/axrh0fr4zlga1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1bf4b007424c7e5d9ee95021e8a7b36b49820104)

I got in touch with the support again, and I was told to wait two more days to get an answer.

I also wanted to state that before I ordered, I had 2 student discount codes, one from Unidays and one from Dell's website. The first one (10% off any Alienware product) never worked, always stated the code was expired even though I tried regenerating 3 times.

The second stated it was not applicable to the items in the cart even though it was supposed to be used with all Alienware monitors (I have proof for both codes).

So I had already lost several hours with the customer service to get at least the 5% code working, and didn't get discount on my order in the end as the support kept bouncing me from one service to another without any actual solution.

I ended paying full price, and now this ? It is my first Alienware product, and needless to say, I'm **VERY disappointed** with the ""support"".

Finally, my last complaint is that there are still no news about a firmware update that would fix the EOTF tracking of the HDR1000 mode.

Below a short video of the scratched panel :

PowerEdge R7425 Fans at Max Speed
"I know this is a known issue with Dell servers but I am hoping someone knows a solution.

I purchased a Dell PowerEdge R7425 3 years ago from Dell. No issues until the warranty expired. I had to decide if I wanted to buy a new server or upgrade my existing one. I chose upgrade. So I bought the following compatible products:

1. The best processors I could get for my socket
2. More RAM exactly the same as I had in there already
3. BOSS Card
4. NVIDIA Tesla T4
5. Dell X550-T4 4 port 10gbe Daughter Card

I believe all was good until I put in the networking card. Once I did the fans went from normal to max RPM (17k according to LifeCycle Controller). Here is what I have tried:

1. Upgraded all firmware possible through LifeCycle Controller. The inventory collection just freezes so I cannot make sure it is downloading firmware for my new hardware.
2. Tried using IPMITOOL to manually set the fan speed.
3. Tried setting the fan offset to low and thermal profile to sound cap.

The max power option says I have to enter a value between 100-100...seriously. This is a pretty common problem if people try to add hardware to their servers. I feel like Dell is doing this as a way to make people pay for support. Does anyone know a way to fix the issue? I do not want to downgrade my network card to 1gb as I just upgrade my routers to 10gbe for the house."

"pls help me, dell xps 9570

So I have a 2018 dell xps 9570. Everything was fine with it until a small part of the charging port or dock(whatever its called) broke off.

 I go to a computer repair guy, he replaces the part and when I pick it up he also gives me a free new charger(???).  I go home, turn it on and plug it in and immediately notice its a tight fit with both the old and new charger, but they still both fit, and the lights on them light up so I know they are both working. 

But the real problem comes now, at first when plugged in the charging light indicator on the laptop lights up and then just turns off. Everything else functions and the laptop status in windows goes it's charging. But it will not charge properly, when I got the laptop back it was 54% I plugged in and used it for a while and it went down to 51%. I knew it was still pulling some charge because the amount of time I used it would have normally been completely dead without a charge. Then at some point I was using it without realizing it wasnt on the charger and it hit 6%, I turned it off and left it on the charger for an hour. Turned it back on and it was still on 6%! Used it for a while on the charger and it's down to 5%. I tell the repair guy and he asks me if I used the charger I gave to him?? Neither charger works with the laptop anymore and it shouldn't matter my old charger should work anyway. Does anyone know what happened? What did this guy do to my laptop?"

"Dell XPS 7590: ""NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650"" has the yellow exclamation mark in Device Manager"
" 

Hi All,

Can't find the solution to this one so finally posting about it.

I use a Dell XPS 15 7590, running the latest version of Windows 10, and ""NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650"" has a yellow exclamation mark in Device Manager.

If I open the settings, it reports that ""Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)"".

I have already attempted the following:

\- Reformat the entire operating system (wiping hard drive, clean install of Windows 10 from a freshly created USB)

\- Tested both GTX 1650 Drivers: The ones that Dell Driver Detect recommends, and also manually choosing the model from NVIDIA's official website

\- Used the NVIDIA driver removal tool, and then done all of the above steps \*again\* in Safe Mode. This actually did remove the exclamation mark, but only for a few minutes, or until I restarted the computer, then it was back - so it wasn't an actual solution.

Because of this, everything is running from the motherboard's onboard GPU, which makes Windows so slow that it is barely useable.

Please, how do I resolve this issue?"

"Hello All!

I have used Dell monitors for years and have had great experience.  In December 2021 I bought a s3221qs 32 inch monitor during their boxing day sales.  That monitor stopped working in April 2022 and they sent a replacement.  Its now February 2023 and the replacement stopped working.  

After 4 hours on the phone with Dell...basically they don't give a shit because based on the original purchase date (dec 2021) the replacement from April 2022 is now out of warranty (ended dec 2022).

So i am left with a several hundred dollar paperweight and no options from Dell for warranty or support. Because I am 43 days out of the original warranty.  So despite 2 monitors shitting the bed within just over 1 year, they are wiping their hands with it all.

Thanks for reading that vent.  Now do you have any suggestions for what I can do?  Pretty sure I am just left hanging."
WD19TBS Causing Weird Blue Pixels on Monitor (HDMI)
"Hello,

I recently purchased a WD19TBS and it is causing my monitor to have these [weird blue pixels](https://imgur.com/a/sGBsxDM). The dock was purchased from EBay, however it was from a well-reviewed seller and the claim of it being completely new and genuine appears to be authentic (official Dell box, paperwork, seal intact, etc).

When I hook it up to my laptop, these blue pixels appear. I have tried rotating the usb-c connection (no effect), changing the port of the usb-c connection (no effect), and reseating the HDMI cord on both the monitor and dock (no effect).

I thought I could safely assume the monitor and HDMI cable are not the issue as this issue didn't occur with a previous cheap usb-c dock from amazon (checked it again and the issue is not present with it). However the screenshot I took only shows the blue pixels on the monitor, but when I drag the image to my laptop screen the blue pixels disappear and the correct image is shown, so perhaps it is the monitor??? Monitor is a Samsung S27F350FHN, computer is a Precision 5760.

I have updated the dock fully using Dell Command Support and restarted, the issue occured before the update and persists after as well.

Any thoughts?"
"Another anti-Waves/Maxxaudio post, for those who hate the ""enhancements"" but are stuck with them on their work computers: how to disable ""enhancement"""
"I am on the side of hating the audio ""enhancements"" that dell gives you. I personally can't stand the echo and poorly done bass boost. Awful how it nukes the speaker volume if you disable it. I use headphones most of the time, and the features are far more apparent that way than using the laptop speakers.

I use a dell laptop through my employer and tried to figure out how to remove the enhancements all together. I was able to uninstall Waves/Maxxaudio but to my dismay, the audio then defaulted to the enhancements with seemingly no way to disable them now that the program was gone. I don't have admin rights on my computer due to my employer, so I couldn't reinstall it. After exploring around, I found a solution that I wanted to share, if anyone finds it helpful:

* right click on volume icon in taskbar
* open sound settings
* choose audio output device
* click on Device properties
* under Related Settings, click Additional device properties
* 'Advanced' tab
* uncheck Enable audio enhancements
   * FINALLY awful echo/bass boost is switched off

The only good thing about waves/maxxaudio is that I could turn it off in one button. Hope this can help anyone it applies to  Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯"

Dell Inspiron 7373 2-in-1 Blank Screen Issue
"Hey,  
I have the task of fixing my brother's laptop as the ""IT support"" of my family XD  
His laptop just shows blank screen whenever the display turns off (at least based on my observation). Example of this is when it sleeps either from timeout or closing the lid, shutting down then booting up again, restarting. I've tried many things already. Installed all Windows update and even upgrade to Windows 11, used Dell Update to update many things such as the graphics driver. Last thing that I can't do is updating the BIOS because Dell Update fails. Executing the standalone installer won't work because it reboots the laptop and so it just boots to a blank screen.

Getting back to a normal boot takes a few tries of holding the power button to turn it off or on. What do you thing can I do on this?

Iâ€™ve tried everything I can think of to fix it, but I canâ€™t. The system simply will not let me get to the menu to boot into safe mode - from the recovery tool if I click the start up options, it will restart regularly and go straight to windowsâ€¦ I thought maybe my memory was bad, but I cycled sticks and it canâ€™t be that. 

I canâ€™t do a system restore because there is no restore point. I canâ€™t do a driver roll back, it says it is unavailable for both options. Near as I can tell, every recovery option possible does not work. 

So I went and created a Support OS Recovery USB thumb drive on my laptop to format my PC and reinstall windows.

Am I missing something? I made the thumb drive with Dells tool using the service tag of my PC. It launches fine. At â€œreset and updateâ€ it just simply will not let me go any further. Does anyone know what I can do here? I attached a picture (from my phone) of where I am stuck.

Comma d Update app unable to download catalogs
"I have a Dell venue 11 pro 5130 with windows 8.1 installed. I am struggling with drivers for this tablet. On the dell website, it lists all of them for download. These drivers refuse to run at all. I have wifi working so far.

I was going to try the dell command update app to check for drivers automatically. It gives an error saying it is unable to download the needed catalogs.

Any tips? I might just try windows 10 on it again. Maybe I can get it lite enough to run decently."
Do all replacement screens for the G3 15 3590 comes with 40 pin connectors?
"I'm looking to upgrade my screen on my laptop. (Hinges are broken anyways.) I don't want to link this post to any store in particular as I'm concerned about this being taken down.

But I'm looking at this screen replacement (hinges and all):

Dell G3 15 3590 Series 15.6"" 1920x1080 Full HD Matte 144Hz WLED IPS Laptop Black Back Cover Hinges Cable Complete LCD **Screen Assembly M3RWN**

Does anyone know if these replacement screens come with 40 pin connectors? Thats what my dell laptop has. I heard some laptops screen replacements come with 30 pin. 

I've asked the stores that are selling this screen to see if they know if it comes with 40 pins and no one will give me this information. (Not surprised. I wasn't expecting them too. Worth it shot though.)"

How to activate 2560x1440 on a dual-display setup using a WD19TB dock?
"Thing is I can get one monitor setup with that resolution but not the other, Monitor 2 is set MAX @ 1920x1080. Is it just the bandwidth limitations of the docking station? I am using two display ports. Monitors are in SST & 1.2. Dock seems to have latest drivers as well. Perhaps it's the monitor's limitations? And possibly could try 1 DP cable & 1 USB-C cable to see if that'll work..."
DW5930e Change Carrier
"Howdy!

I purchased a Latitude 7430 recently and I guess I put the wrong spec in my order and my eSIM is setup for AT&T and not Verizon.  I've been doing a lot of reading online on how to *maybe* switch it, but it involves Linux and although I consider myself fairly savvy, I am not that savvy.

I'm looking for a simple solution to change it (DW5930e - Snapdragon X55) from AT&T to Verizon.

Thanks in advance!"

inspiron 1545...what am I doing wrong?
"
Hi all,

 I received a Dell inspiron 1545 from a family member who was wanting me to fix it up to be able to use. I upgraded the ram to 8gb, installed windows on a SSD, and bought a processor on eBay to upgrade the unit. Everything worked fine until I replaced the processor, and now the unit acts like it wants to start but will not boot to bios or anything,even after replacing the original processor. 

I thought maybe I killed the motherboard doing this, the original 1545 was a single core so I thought maybe going from single to dual core caused the issue.

I found another old inspiron someone was selling for parts around 15 dollars. I thought I would upgrade that unit instead. I bought a computer with a dual core processor and again, everything worked just fine until I attempted to swap out the cpu. Again I get an attempt to boot with nothing going anywhere on a second machine. I made sure the bios was updated, redid the thermal paste, etc to the latest version before upgrading the cpu.

What am I doing wrong?  This is the 2nd machine this has happened to, so I am thinking the processor i originally bought might be faulty? But regardless if I out the original processor back nothing happens as well. I am happy to provide more info just a little flustered right now"
