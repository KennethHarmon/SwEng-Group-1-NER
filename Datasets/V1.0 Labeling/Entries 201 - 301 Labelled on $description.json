I can not start the workstation by resetting the power.\n\nAnd Dell promises to send a technician to help. for your information, I have waited from Thursday 3rd Nov until 8st Nov 2021 to get a technician to help.\n\nDell sends the motherboard to the technician and asks them to replace it, however, workstation 5820 is not the regular type of Dell product, and the technicians are not trained to disassemble the machine. \n\nSo the technician decided to help me test data rather than tearing the machine apart, which might cause extra damage.\n\nThe reason that technician doesn't suggest I replace the motherboard was due to two reasons.\n\nFirst, Dell didn't send the motherboard properly, and the part might have already been damaged from transition(the technician showed me the part of the motherboard already split),\n\nSecond, the technician didn't train to replace this particular type of device and he told me most Dell technicians didn't train to fix this complex type of device, so there was no technician who would answer this case, which keep me waiting longer than usual.\n\nI asked him what if the problems happen again, and what would he suggest I do with it. He told me the better way is to send the workstation back to Dell and let a professional run the test for it.\n\nAfter the data test, everything seems ok and the technician helps me to reset the power and sleep mode from hybrid to regular mode, which he assumes might cause the abnormal start problem.\n\nAfter he has gone, the workstation works normally for days.\n\nToday the problem shows again, I went to Dell's website and the online assistant told me they will send technician to help.\n\nCan you all see the problems of this?\n\n1. Assistants can not figure out what might be the problem.\n\n2. Online assistant decided to send a technician who does not know how to deal with this kind of device.\n\n3. Online service told me I can not send the device back to Dell(they only accept laptops for this), which is what their onsite technician suggest I ask Dell for a box to send it back if the problem happened again.\n\n4. Technicians don't know how to disassemble the device to replace the motherboard might cause damage to the workstation, also the motherboard is already damaged from the transition. Who should be responsible if the data from the workstation damaged by this unthoughtful action?\n\nI suggested all my friends and family pick Dell as their first choice before.

This was not a cheap purchase, and I am otherwise quite happy with the laptop, but these internet issues are a bit disappointing, and I'm hoping there is a fix.\n\nMany thanks for any suggestions!"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-01T11:33:00.585631Z","updated_at":"2023-03-01T12:16:18.647670Z","inner_id":15,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":4,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":16,"annotations":[{"id":18,"completed_by":1,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-01T12:16:21.688220Z","updated_at":"2023-03-01T12:16:21.688220Z","lead_time":2.46,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":16,"project":4,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"73a230bc-dell_output_tcd.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":216,"title":"I just got a Dell Precision 7770; I have some questions (posting them as a comment)","description":""},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-01T11:33:00.585631Z","updated_at":"2023-03-01T12:16:21.884346Z","inner_id":16,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":4,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":17,"annotations":[{"id":19,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":202,"end":211,"text":"Oculus VR","labels":["SPEC"]},"id":"ULJdNydiVV","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":16,"end":34,"text":"All in one desktop","labels":["SPEC"]},"id":"BVHTK9qy-n","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":86,"end":111,"text":"upgrade the graphics card","labels":["NON_TECH_ISSUE"]},"id":"egU7966yIN","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":157,"end":180,"text":"reasonably priced cards","labels":["NON_TECH_ISSUE"]},"id":"L9xKBS8sn9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-01T12:16:47.817876Z","updated_at":"2023-03-01T12:16:47.817876Z","lead_time":25.421,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":17,"project":4,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"73a230bc-dell_output_tcd.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":217,"title":"Dell Inspiron 5400 11th gen i7 2.80 GHz 16G ram","description":"I just got this All in one desktop for my son and I’m wondering if I would be able to upgrade the graphics card?

However, upon restarting the computer again, it would no longer boot and would freeze on the dell logo screen, completely unresponsive to any kind of input. I have tried contacting Dell but they immediately labeled my request as \"completed\", most likely because I switched the OS from Windows to a non-supported OS. I have tried the following and they all yield the exact same result (except for the last one):\n\n* Unplugging all peripherals and disconnecting power, holding power button for 30 seconds, then reconnecting the power and trying to boot\n* Unplugging the HDD and trying to boot\n* Disconnected CMOS battery from the main board for 15 minutes, plugged it back in, and tried to boot.\n* Following the steps to clear the CMOS settings (This resulted in the computer turning on with no dell logo for about 10 to 15 seconds, then turning off, then turning back on again, and getting stuck on the dell logo screen again)\n\nI get the feeling I most likely bricked the system. To be honest, it's an older computer we had laying around and I won't be upset if there's nothing I can do to fix it, breaking things is part of the learning process. I do have a different computer which I use as my main computer and I do still have the USB I used for the Ubuntu installation as well (just in case that info comes in handy).

The USB-C connected S2722QC is at 59.997Hz (not a problem), and the one connected via HDMI 2.0 is getting 60Hz. Both S2722QC are 4K 3840x2160.

All three seem to have an issue with the HDMI input. The main observations are:\n\n1. The monitor will randomly go black, requiring a power cycle to get the monitor to turn back on. As far as the computer is concerned, the monitor still looks to be connected, but the monitor is otherwise black\n2. Often times, when the computer goes to sleep the monitor does not go in to power-save mode, but rather stays on with just a black screen and the backlight on\n\nWhen I originally purchased these monitors I experienced this. Not realizing it was specific to just the HDMI inputs, and since the monitors were brand new, I went through the RMA process for two of the monitors. However, both the new monitors had the same issue.\n\nI have described this in more detail on the dell forums here:\n\n[Re: U2720Q, three, two PC's, randomly go black - Dell Community](https:\/\/www.dell.com\/community\/Monitors\/U2720Q-three-two-PC-s-randomly-go-black\/m-p\/7684022#M128918)\n\nAnd it seems I'm not the only one, e.g.:\n\n[Re: U2720Q, randomly turning off the screen - Dell Community](https:\/\/www.dell.com\/community\/Monitors\/U2720Q-randomly-turning-off-the-screen\/m-p\/8296799#M144356)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn my experience, this is only an issue on the HDMI inputs. It has occurred on every monitor I've used. I've tested this with a number of different HDMI cables as well as different machines (two different dell laptops, a thinkpad laptop, and two different custom-built desktops).\n\nUltimately, I switched to using the DP inputs and USB-C input, neither of which have shown this behavior, and moved on, otherwise happy with the monitors.\n\nI now find myself in a situation where I need access to the HDMI inputs, though. There seems to be no indication from Dell that this is a known issue, and I don't see any firmware updates anywhere available for these monitors.\n\nI assume that this point I'm out of luck, but I'm curious if there are any options here I'm missing in terms of resolving this issue."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-03-01T11:33:00.585631Z","updated_at":"2023-03-01T14:06:28.966581Z","inner_id":31,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":4,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":32,"annotations":[{"id":77,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":60,"end":65,"text":"Anker","labels":["ORG\/BRAND"]},"id":"MS_Jv4oMnF","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":116,"end":179,"text":"new 2nd monitor and attempt to detect it, it doesn't detect it.","labels":["TECH_ISSUE"]},"id":"xsBTSxzaJ_","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":290,"end":430,"text":"XPS 8930 Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-9400 CPU @ 2.90GHz 2.90 GHz\\n\\n16 Gb RAM\\n\\n64-bit operating system, x64-based processor\\n\\nRunning Windows 11 Pro","labels":["SPEC"]},"id":"qQxWb3IvOW","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":432,"end":472,"text":"Service Tag: 56SHPX2\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;","labels":["ID"]},"id":"ByXu1q3pzi","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-03-01T14:07:05.690273Z","updated_at":"2023-03-01T14:07:05.690273Z","lead_time":33.771,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":32,"project":4,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"73a230bc-dell_output_tcd.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":232,"title":"How do I find out if my USB-C port supports DP-ALT mode?","description":"I'm trying to run a monitor from the USB-C port.
